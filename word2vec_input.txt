The Information Commissioner's Office ('ICO') published, on 3 August 2020, a monetary penalty notice in which it fined Rain Trading Ld £80,000 under the Data Protection Act 1998 for making, between 1 January 2018 and 29 November 2018, 270,774 unsolicited direct marketing calls to subscribers registered with Telephone Preference Service Ltd ('TPS') without valid consent, in violation of regulation 21 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 ('PECR'). In particular, the ICO outlined that it had sent, on 8 January 2019, an initial investigation letter to RTL, to which it responded, among other things, that it had purchased the data for direct marketing purposes under contract from two third party data providers, that consent was not recorded, and that any due diligence checks were thought to have been carried out by the third party data providers. Furthermore, the ICO noted that RTL had intended to implement measures including options for recording consent, staff training and software to allow TPS-screening.

In assessing the contraventions, the ICO highlighted that it did not consider that RTL deliberately set out to contravene the PECR, however that it should have been aware of its responsibilities regarding due diligence and taking reasonable steps to prevent such violations. In calculating the monetary penalty, the ICO consider factors such as RTL ceasing its live marketing calls, complaints received to the ICO and the TPS as well as the lack of any internal suppression list to stop repeated calls to the same subscribers. As a result, the ICO issued a monetary penalty notice of £80,000 to be paid by 3 September 2020 at the latest and which can be reduced by 20% to £64,000 if paid by 2 September 2020 to promote compliance with the PECR.

In particular, an ICO spokesperson said, "We have an ongoing investigation relating to Barclays' alleged use of employee monitoring tools."

More specifically, the spokesperson outlined, "People expect that they can keep their personal lives private and that they are also entitled to a degree of privacy in the workplace [...] If organisations wish to monitor their employees, they should be clear about its purpose and that it brings real benefits. Organisations also need to make employees aware of the nature, extent and reasons for any monitoring."The European Commission ('the Commission') and the U.S. Department of Commerce ('DoC') issued, on 10 August 2020, a joint statement announcing that they had initiated discussions to evaluate the potential for an enhanced EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework to comply with the Court Justice of the European Union's ('CJEU') judgment in Data Protection Commissioner v. Facebook Ireland Limited, Maximillian Schrems (C-311/18) ('the Schrems II Case').

In particular, Datatilsynet highlighted that the IB grades were not correct because they did not reflect individual academic ability, thereby leading to discrimination, and that the processing was not in line with the reasonable expectations of data subjects, thus contradicting the fairness principle of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In addition, Datatilsynet noted that the processing taking place through this grading system may lead to denial of opportunities for students and that, in this case, it has adversely affected students in an undue and unjustifiable manner. On this basis, Datatilsynet gave the IBO the opportunity to submit its comments to the Order by 14 August 2020 and stated that, following these comments, a final decision will be taken.

In particular, the FCC highlighted that consumer data is being aggregated and monetised for advertisement placement purposes, and that this data is being used to track consumers' locations to protests and places of worship. In this respect, the FCC noted that Starks is seeking information into AT&T and Verizon's participation in real-time bidding exchanges for mobile advertising, and is requesting details on each provider's policies and procedures to prohibit or minimise tracking of consumers. Specifically the FCC outlined that the letters sent to the service providers ask, among other things, the companies to explain their participation in monetising or using customer data intended for advertising placement to advance non-advertising objectives, to quantify the amount of US location data distributed in real-time bidding processes, and to detail policies in place to minimise, destroy, or prohibit the tracking of consumers according to their data.

The FCC noted that this follows a bipartisan group of members of the U.S. Congress sending a letter on the same to the Federal Trade Commission ('FTC'), requesting an investigation into such practices.

In particular, the update of the Standard aims to allow the Health Data Hub, under certain conditions, to access the relevant personal data in the context of processing activities which present a low risk for impact on the right to privacy. Specifically, the Standard specifies that access conditions include processing activities carried out for the purposes of research, study or analysis in the health sector, which serve the public interest, and for which access to the EGB, SNIIRAM or the related datamarts is necessary. In addition, the Standard highlights that, for such specific purposes of processing, neither the opinion of the Committee for Research, Study and Analysis in the health sector ('CESREES') nor authorisation from CNIL will need to be obtained.

Furthermore, the Standard has been updated with, among other things, a list of purposes for processing which can benefit from the new and simplified procedure, which includes changes in care, comparative analysis of treatment, description and analysis of patient pathologies and treatment plans. Moreover, the Standard adds that manufacturers and insurance providers working in the health sector can also benefit from the simplified access procedure, although they are required to collaborate with laboratories. Lastly, the Standard details that, where necessary, the period for which data can be accessed may be extended once for a maximum period of 24 months.

In particular, the UODO highlighted that the processing was contrary to Article 6(1)(c) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), as the legal acts regulating the principles of the functioning of educational institutions do not specify such tasks and obligations. However, the UODO noted that a reprimand was sufficient at this stage, as the school took immediate corrective actions such as destroying the questionnaire forms and organising employee training to raise awareness of the protection of personal data.

In particular, the Datatilsynet highlighted that a trade union had complained on behalf of one of its members that a company processes information about fingerprints with a view to unambiguously identifying which employee is approaching and leaving the workplace. Furthermore, the Decision outlines that one of the council members did not believe that the Datatilsynet was competent to deal with the issue, as the matter is covered by the Danish Employers' Confederation and the Danish Trade Union Confederation ('the DA/LO Agreement') on control measures, so the member believed that the trade union system was the right forum.

In the Decision, the Datatilsynet highlighted that the company stated that this was a control measure which had been notified in accordance with the main agreement between the DA/LO Agreement. Furthermore, the Datatilsynet noted that the company justified the control measure on the grounds that it is crucial for food safety, including the company's export opportunities, that unauthorised persons do not gain access to the production site and that it can be identified at any time who has participated in the production of a given product. Moreover, the Datatilsynet outlined in the Decision that key tags that employees scan do not provide sufficient assurance that it can be unambiguously identified who has been present in the production, as there may be theft of key tags or replacement of key tags, both incorrectly and intentionally. In addition, the Datatilsynet emphasised that the system does not store images of the individual's fingerprint, but a unique template based on the fingerprint. Specifically, the scanner is designed so that data in the scanner, should it fall into the wrong hands, could not be used without a copy of the associated database, and that the database is located on a server at the group's head office that only the IT department's employees have access to via a separate coding system. Furthermore, the Datatilsynet noted that non-employees do not have access to the company's PCs, and that the information in the system can only be accessed by the few employees who have a work-related need for this, which only includes the IT department and the group's payroll office.

After an overall review, the Datatilsynet found that there was no basis for overriding the company's assessment as the processing could therefore take place in accordance with Article 5 of the GDPR and Section 12(1) of Act No. 502 of 23 May 2018 on Supplementary Provisions to the Regulation on the Protection of Natural Persons with Regard to the Processing of Personal Data and on the Free Movement of Such Data.

You can read the press release, only available in Spanish, here.The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman ('the Ombudsman') announced, on 05 August 2020, that the Sanctions Chamber of the Ombudsman ('the Sanctions Chamber'), had issued a decision ('the Decision') in which it had fined Independent Consulting Oy (Acc Consulting Varsinais-Suomi) €7,000 for sending electronic direct marketing messages without prior consent and for non-compliance with the data subject rights. In particular, the Decision relates to 11 complaints received by the Ombudsman relating to the company's direct electronic marketing and non-exercise of data subject rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In addition, the Sanctions Chamber held that the company could not rely on the defence that it had conducted targeted electronic direct marketing to entities which do not require consent under the Act on Electronic Communications Services (917/2014), as the company had not conducted any assessments prior to the marketing considering, among other things, the recipient's job.

Moreover, the Decision notes that some of the complaints concerned the fact that data subjects had made requests to the controller for their rights under the GDPR and that the controller had not responded to the requests as required without undue delay and within a maximum of one month of receipt of the request. In addition, the Decision highlights that the controller did not appear to have organised its procedures for processing personal data in such a way that it can indicate whether it had exercised the data subjects' rights or received requests for rights and that therefore was unable to demonstrate that it had processed personal data lawfully.

Lastly, the Decision outlines that the Deputy Ombudsman of the Office also obliges the controller to rectify its conduct with regard to direct marketing and has ordered the company to change its practices and exercise the data subject's rights in accordance with the GDPR.

You can read the press release here.The French data protection authority ('CNIL') announced, on 5 August 2020, its decision ('the Decision') issued on 28 July 2020 to impose a €250,000 fine on Spartoo SAS for violating multiple provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In particular, the Decision outlines that Spartoo breached the principle of data minimisation under Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR, retained the data for longer than was necessary under Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR, as well as failed to abide by the obligation to inform under Article 13 of the GDPR, and to take adequate measures to ensure the security of data as required by Article 32 of the GDPR. More specifically, in light of the purposes of processing data for employee training and fraud prevention, CNIL considered that the permanent recording of telephone calls with customer service employees, the recording of customer bank details, and the collection of customers' health cards were excessive and, thus, contrary to data minimisation.

In addition, CNIL found that the Spartoo had not set up a retention period for customer and prospect data, and also did not regularly erase and archive personal data. Moreover, CNIL held that retaining, for a period exceeding five years, names and passwords in a non-anonymised form to enable customers to re-use their account contradicted Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR. Moreover, CNIL held that customers were misinformed about the legal bases for the data processing and that employees had not been adequately informed about the purpose behind the processing, the recipients of the data, the data retention period, and their rights, which meant that Spartoo breached its obligation to provide information under Article 13 of the GPDR. Lastly, CNIL noted that Spartoo had not used adequately strong passwords for accessing customer accounts and, thus, failed to ensure the security of data processed by the company as required by Article 32 of the GDPR.

Therefore, CNIL, also taking into account the three million clients and 25 million prospects affected, as well as the retention of bank data, imposed a €250,000 fine on Spartoo and asked that it brings its processing in conformity with the GDPR within three months of the notification of the Decision.

In particular, the Findings note that the complaint highlighted TD's decision to outsource aspects of its fraud claims processing services to a third-party service provider in India and that TD did not obtain consent for, or allow customers to opt-out of, the transfer of personal information to a service provider in a foreign jurisdiction.

In this respect, the Findings outline that the third-party service provider was using TD customers' information to manage fraud claims for TD and that TD was not required to obtain separate consent for or to provide customers the choice to opt-out of, the transfer of personal information to the third-party service provider for that same purpose. In addition, the Findings highlight that TD was sufficiently open about this transfer, provided customers with information pertaining to its transfers, and also made this information available through its privacy resources, as well as had been accountable with respect to the information it transferred and ensured a comparable level of protection for that information. As such, the Findings conclude that the complaint was not well-founded and that TD had met its requirements under Canada's federal private sector privacy legislation.

In particular, the Letter outlines the view that the FTC does not function as an effective privacy agency and that the U.S. Congress should establish an independent data protection agency, with the Senate Commerce Committee instead scheduling a hearing on Senate Bill 3300 to establish a Federal data protection agency. Specifically, the Letter notes three key points for the Senate Commerce Committee's consideration in this respect, highlighting the FTC's failure to stop mergers that threaten consumer privacy, the FTC's failure to establish data protection standards as it cannot enforce its own consent orders, and the general need for a US data protection agency because of the lacking authority and expertise of the FTC.
