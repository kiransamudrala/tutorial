130,https://www.dataguidance.com/news/eu-insurance-europe-publishes-insight-briefing-european-insurance-industrys-views-ai,EU: Insurance Europe publishes insight briefing on European insurance industry's views on AI," Insurance Europe announced, on 3 August 2020, that it had published an insight briefing ('the Insight Briefing') about the European insurance industry's views on artificial intelligence ('AI'). Furthermore, Insurance Europe outlined three challenges in maximising the benefit for both consumers and themselves in their use of AI. Firstly, Insurance Europe noted that when developing AI systems, insurers face restricted access to data from the public sector, and stated that, for maximum societal benefit, such datasets should be available for free and in a machine-readable format. In addition, Insurance Europe highlighted that the non-personal data for some AI applications is also sometimes concentrated in the hands of a few entities, resulting in restricted or expensive access to data that could improve AI systems and better serve customers.  Insurance Europe further noted in the Insight Briefing that insurers would like to see a holistic approach to regulation. Moreover, Insurance Europe stated that the EU legal framework already covers areas relevant to AI such as fundamental rights, privacy, and data protection, as well as product safety and liability, which is then complemented by national regulatory frameworks. To support the development and uptake of AI, and to avoid unnecessary regulatory burdens, Insurance Europe noted that a horizontal, proportionate, and principles-based AI regulatory framework is needed that builds on existing EU and national regulatory frameworks. Insurance Europe also opined that there is currently a lack of effective collaboration between authorities with responsibilities in the field of digitalisation and that there is a need for all national authorities, whether they are responsible for the conduct of business, prudential regulation, competition, or data protection, to work closely together and ensure consistency in applying the rules to further develop the digital single market.  Furthermore, Insurance Europe stipulated that new EU rules for AI are only required if there are gaps in existing legislation, and for this reason, European (re)insurers do not support the creation of a civil liability regime for the use of AI because developing any kind of strict liability and compulsory insurance scheme for AI would not work. In addition, as Insurance Europe noted in the Insight Briefing, the conditions for mandatory insurance, which include sufficient similarity in the risks being covered and sufficient data on the risks, are not met. Moreover, Insurance Europe called for existing legislation to be reviewed to see if it creates barriers to AI, for example, further guidance on the application of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). Finally, Insurance Europe called for the deployment of ethical, trustworthy, and human-centric AI via an appropriate, risk-based, and proportionate regulatory framework. The scope of the framework should be targeted only at those AI applications with proven high risk and significant effects on the rights of individuals, as not all uses of AI pose significant risks or directly impact consumers. In the context of financial services legislation, and insurance, in particular, principles such as transparency, fairness, accountability, and ethics are to some extent already addressed by rules on the conduct of business and disclosure, while rules on advice apply whether the recommendation is provided by a human or by AI.

In particular, the AEPD held that although personal data is collected in order to trace the infection of Coronavirus, such data is not classified as sensitive personal data. Moreover, the AEPD highlighted that if consent is used as a legal basis for data processing, no negative consequences, such as the prevention of entry, could be imposed to persons that do not want to provide consent. In addition, the AEPD found that a mandatory obligation to provide personal data can be based on a legal obligation and Article 6(1)(e) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') as it would be justified by the public interest. Furthermore, the AEPD found that health authorities should assess in which public spaces it is necessary to impose a mandatory identification requirement, taking into account whether there could be more moderate measures and the specificities of the sphere, highlighting among other things, nightclubs and museums.  Finally, the AEPD held that the principle of data minismisation must be respected and that it can sometimes be sufficient to obtain a telephone number to trace an infection. The AEPD found that identification through a national identiy card is always unnecessary because it is considered to be disproportionate.

In particular, NAV announced that under the amended VAT Act, the monetary condition for the obligation to provide information is abolished and that all invoices issued by a taxable person to another domestic taxable person for a domestic transaction (excluding intra-community supplies of goods), regardless of the VAT content of the invoice, must be reported to NAV. Moreover, NAV announced that because the COVID-19 ('Coronavirus') emergency situation prevented taxpayers to adequately prepare for the new legal obligation, it will grant a transition period at least until 30 September 2020, during which it will not impose a penalty if the taxpayer fails to fulfil their obligation to provide the required account data.  The NAV issued, on 8 July 2020, an additional Statement ('the Additional Statement') highlighting that the amendments of the VAT Act require that the first eight digits of the tax number of the person purchasing a product or using a service must be indicated on the invoice issued for a domestic transaction. However, NAV stressed that this is only necessary if a person subject to VAT acquires a product or uses a service, and held that an invoice can therefore continue to be issued without a customer tax number if the person acquiring the product and using the service is not a VAT payer. Furthermore, the NAV provided examples for situations in which the requirements do not apply such as a national or foreign private person or an international organisation.  Finally, NAV held that if a customer who purchases the product and uses a service declares, orally or in writing, that they do not have a tax number or are not subject to VAT in a specific transaction, the invoice does not have to include a customer tax number.

Facebook Ireland Limited, Maximillian Schrems (C-311/18) ('the Schrems II Case') and a first assessment on the impact the decision has on data transfers to the US and other third countries. In particular, the DSK held that transfers of personal data to the US based on the Privacy Shield are inadmissible and must cease based on the CJEU's decision that US law does not provide protection that is in essence equal to EU law. Furthermore, the DSK held that Standard Contractual Clauses ('SCCs') may in principle continue to be used, however it emphasised the CJEU's ruling on the responsibility of the transferring and recepient parties to assess whether the rights of data subjects have an equal level of protection in the third country, which is a precondition for deciding if guarantees included in SCCs can be realised or if further measures need to be taken. In this regard, the DSK highlighted that in cases of data transfers to the US, SCCs without further measures are insufficient.  Moreover, the DSK highlighted that the CJEU's findings also have an impact on Binding Corporate Rules ('BCRs') and additional measures need to be taken if the rights of data subject are not protected to the same level in a third country. In addition, the DSK held that data transfers to the US and other third countries under Article 49 of the GDPR continue to be admissible if all conditions are fulfilled in each individual case. The DSK equally found that responsible persons that wish to continue transferring data to the US or other third countries need to assess immediately if they fulfill the requirements, as the CJEU did not provide for a transitional period.  Finally, the DSK highlighted that supervisory authorities play a key role in the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') and data transfers and announced that, upon harmonisation with other European supvervisory authorities, they should also advise on specific questions on data transfers, also endorsing the FAQs ('the FAQs') issued by the European Data Protection Board ('EDPB').

In particular, in the first decision, the BGH found that the claimant's asserted claim regarding the delisting of the disputed links does not result from Article 17(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), referring to the CJEU and German Federal Constitutional Court jurisprudence, according to which Article 17(1) of the GDPR requires a comprehensive consideration of fundamental rights based on all relevant circumstances of the individual case, and taking into account the severity of the interference with the fundamental rights of the data subject on the one hand, and the fundamental rights of the defendants, the interests of its users, and the public, as well as the fundamental rights of the providers of the content demonstrated in the contested result links on the other. Moreover, the BGH held that there is no presumption of a priority for the protection interests of the concerned person, but that the conflicting fundamental rights are to be weighed up equally and that it would follow from the principle of equal consideration that the person responsible for a search engine does not have to take action until they become aware of an obvious and at first glance recognisable violation of the rights of the concerned person.  Furthermore, in the second decision, the BGH held that the CJEU must clarify whether it is compatible with the rights of the concerned person to the respect of their private life and protection of their personal data, to weigh up the conflicting rights and interests under the European Charter of Fundamental Rights when the link that is requested to be removed leads to content that contains factual claims and factual value judgments whose truthfulness and legality is disputed and the legal situation in case of involvement by third parties.

Moreover, the Decision states that NAIH had failed to meet an administrative deadline and must pay damages of HUF 10,000 (approx. €29). In addition, the Decision notes that there is no administrative appeal against the Decision but that it can be challenged in an administrative lawsuit within 30 days.  Dr. Márton Domokos, Senior Counsel at CMS Cameron McKenna Nabarro Olswang LLP told OneTrust DataGuidance: ""The complainant's subject access request was rather complex. He had requested detailed information on what kind of ads, websites, and advertisers are processed together with his name (as an advertising keyword). The complainant was also interested in seeing how many Google AdWords advertisement Google showed when a user searched for the complainant's name, and asked information about the algorithm used by Google Ireland. Google Ireland failed to respond to the complainant's access request in due time but, eventually, it sent an answer to the complainant's questions. Despite the request of the complainant, NAIH did not request a proceeding before Google Ireland's lead supervisory authority, Ireland's Data Protection Commission, because NAIH did not find a systemic problem regarding the general subject access request policies of Google Ireland.""

In particular, the ACCC alleged that Google had failed to inform consumers and gain their explicit informed consent in relation to its move in 2016 to start combining personal information in consumers' Google accounts with information about those individuals' activities on non-Google sites that used Google technology, formerly DoubleClick technology, to display adverts.

ACCC Chair Rod Sims stated, ''The use of this new combined information allowed Google to increase significantly the value of its advertising products, from which it generated much higher profits […] The ACCC considers that consumers effectively pay for Google's services with their data, so this change introduced by Google increased the ''price'' of Google's services, without consumers' knowledge.''

Further to the Hospital's argument, the HDPA noted that a limitation of its competence to decide upon matters related to national security does not contradict the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), but highlighted that a general reliance upon national security does not suffice to exclude the jurisdiction of the HDPA.  More specifically, the HDPA highlighted that for the exclusion of the HDPA's jurisdiction to be lawful, the processing must directly be linked to activities implicating national security. In addition, the HDPA considered that the Hospital had not proved that the processing of personal data at the entrance was for national security purposes, also noting that the processing of data about the purpose of the hospital visit falls within special categories of personal data under Article 9 of the GDPR. Lastly, the HDPA found that the processing was lawful in accordance with Article 6 of the GDPR, as it gave effect to the public interest of securing hospital facilities in accordance with military regulations, as well as ordering the Hospital to designate a data protection officer ('DPO') because a single DPO for multiple services of the National Defence General Staff cannot, in accordance with Article 37 of the GDPR, ensure that the DPO effectively performs its tasks.

In addition, Heathrow Airport, through its involvement with the Sandbox, developed an Automated Passenger Journey ('APJ') project which would use facial recognition technology ('FRT') to verify the passengers' identity from an ID source.  According to the Heathrow Airport Report, following conversations with the ICO, it appeared that Heathrow Airport would likely be considered as a joint controller with each of their partner airlines for the processing of personal data associated with the APJ. The ICO futher outlined the reasons for this observation, which include, among other things, the fact that Heathrow Airport would jointly, with their airline partners, be making the decision to introduce FRT-based identity verification in the terminal, and determining the means and manner through which FRT-based identity verifications take place in the terminal.
