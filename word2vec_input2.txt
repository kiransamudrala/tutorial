The National Privacy Commission ('NPC') issued, on 12 August 2020, a statement reiterating that the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10173) ('the Data Privacy Act') is not a hinderance to contact tracing initiatives, highlighting that the Data Privacy Act seeks to protect individuals from discrimination, harassment, and acts of social vigilantism amid the COVID-19 ('Coronavirus') pandemic. In particular, the NPC clarified that the Data Privacy Act does not prevent hospitals from sharing a patient's data to proper authorities. In addition, the NPC noted that hospitals are mandated to collect information from patients and provide it to the authorities under the guidelines set by the Department of Health. Moreover, the NPC stated that it has provided public health emergency bulletings and advisory opinions as guidance for personal information controllers, especially healthcare providers.

In particular, the Report examines, among other things, how companies use facial recognition technology, the varying degrees of accuracy across demographic groups, and how privacy issues are addressed in laws and industry practices. Specifically, the Report finds, among other things, that although the accuracy of facial recognition technology has increased, differences in performance exist for certain demographic groups, and with respect to privacy, the main concerns are that individuals are unable to remain anonymous in public, technology is used without individuals' consent, and such technology may collect or store facial images which poses additional risks. As such, the Report reiterates recommendations made in previous reports, suggesting that the U.S. Congress should consider strengthening the consumer privacy framework to reflect changes in technology and the marketplace.

In particular, the plaintiff had taken a loan from the Bank EFG Eurobank A.E. and, further to their delay in repaying the loan, Eurobank transferred the plaintiff's personal data, including the amount of their debt, their name and telephone number, to Eurobank Remedial Services without previously informing them about such transfer. More specifically, Eurobank argued that, by completing an application for a loan, the plaintiff had been informed and had given their clear consent to the processing of their personal data by Eurobank as well as to the disclosure of such data to companies collaborating with Eurobank. The Supreme Court noted that, while the plaintiff was previously informed about the transfer of its data to debt collection societies and Eurobank Remedial Services was not a debt collection society, by providing this information to the plaintiff through the loan application, Eurobank had satisfied the requirements of Article 11 on the right to be informed of Law No. 2472/1997, which was the pre- General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') law. Thus, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Eurobank.

In particular, the Court of Appeal ruled that the High Court erred in concluding that South Wales Police's ('SWP') interference with Bridges' rights under Article 8(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights ('ECHR') was in accordance with the law under Article 8(2) of the ECHR. Specifically, the Court of Appeal held that although the legal framework comprised primary legislation (Data Protection Act 2018 ('the Act')), secondary legislation (the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice), and local policies promulgated by SWP, there was no clear guidance on where the specific type of the automated facial recognition technology could be used and who could be put on a watchlist.

As a result, the Court of Appeal held that this was too broad a discretion to afford to the police officers to meet the standard required by Article 8(2) of the ECHR. In addition, the Court of Appeal held that the SWP failed to provide an adequate Data Protection Impact Assessment ('DPIA'), as required under Section 64 of the Act, and found that as the DPIA was written on the basis that Article 8 was not infringed, the DPIA was deficient.

You can read the statement here.The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ('FINRA') announced, on 10 August 2020, along with the Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') and the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission ('CFTC') enforcement action totalling $38M for anti-money laundering ('AML') failures against Interactive Brokers LLC. In particular, FINRA stated that it had fined Interactive Brokers $15 million for widespread failures in the firm's AML program and noted that part of the settlement - the FINRA Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent ('the FINRA AWC') - requires Interactive Brokers to certify that it will implement the recommendations of a third-party consultant to remedy the failures.

In addition, the SEC Order finds that Interactive Brokers violated the financial recordkeeping and reporting provision of the federal securities laws and a related SEC rule and, as a result, fines Interactive Brokers $11.5 million. Finally, the CFTC action charging Interactive Brokers $11.5 million for a violation of Regulation 42.2. (requiring registrants to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970) marks the first enforcement action of its kind.

Jessica Hopper, FINRA Executive Vice President and Head of Enforcement, stated, "Today's action is a reminder that member firms must tailor their AML programs to the firms' business model and customer base, and also dedicate resources to programs commensurate with their growth and business lines. FINRA will continue to take steps to ensure that firms comply with their obligation to monitor for, detect and report suspicious activity."

In particular, the Deputy Ombudsman noted that the company was disclosing, via telephone and for direct marketing purposes, information obtained from a shareholder register of limited companies and cooperatives and highlighted that, as Euroclear independently decided upon the disclosure of the data, it constituted a controller instead of a processor. In addition, the Deputy Ombudsman held that the use of the telephone was not one of the lawful methods for disclosing information of shareholders and, thus, the processing was not fair as required by the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). Moreover, the Deputy Ombudsman considered that Euroclear had a duty to inform data subjects about the disclosure of data for direct marketing purposes, and that merely mentioning direct marketing on a website is not sufficient to ensure that the data subjects have exercised their right to object to the processing of personal data for direct marketing. Therefore, the Deputy Ombudsman ordered Euroclear to change its shareholder register disclosure practices to ensure compliance with data protection requirements.

Furthermore, the Order details that WAC's subsidiary lacked internal accounting controls sufficient to detect or prevent the payments of such bribes and that the management lacked the appropriate tone in relation to internal audit and compliance. Moreover, in the Order, it is specified that WAC has consented to the Order, which requires WAC to cease and desist from violating the anti-bribery, books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA.

In particular, the standards constitute the first deliverable of the DSA, the authority responsible for cross-government data standardisation which is led by the Government Digital Service, and include best practices for sharing comma-separated values ('CSV') files. Firstly, the standard on using metadata to describe data shared within government discusses using the Dublin Core schema when sharing tabular data, like CSV files and spreadsheets, between government departments. Secondly, the standard on using metadata to describe tabular data for publishing recommends using the schema.org standard on data set to describe the contents of a CSV file, spreadsheet or other file type containing data to be published. Thirdly, the standard on using metadata to describe CSV data offers guidance using the CSV on the Web standard to add metadata to describe the contents and structure of CSV data files.

In addition, the guidance on record information about data sets to be shared with others addresses using metadata to facilitate the cataloguing, validation, reuse and sharing of data. Lastly, the guidance on publishing tabular data covers adding metadata to data being published so that search engines can find the data and display structured results for users.

In particular, the ICO outlined that it had sent, on 8 January 2019, an initial investigation letter to RTL, to which it responded, among other things, that it had purchased the data for direct marketing purposes under contract from two third party data providers, that consent was not recorded, and that any due diligence checks were thought to have been carried out by the third party data providers. Furthermore, the ICO noted that RTL had intended to implement measures including options for recording consent, staff training and software to allow TPS-screening.

In assessing the contraventions, the ICO highlighted that it did not consider that RTL deliberately set out to contravene the PECR, however that it should have been aware of its responsibilities regarding due diligence and taking reasonable steps to prevent such violations. In calculating the monetary penalty, the ICO consider factors such as RTL ceasing its live marketing calls, complaints received to the ICO and the TPS as well as the lack of any internal suppression list to stop repeated calls to the same subscribers. As a result, the ICO issued a monetary penalty notice of £80,000 to be paid by 3 September 2020 at the latest and which can be reduced by 20% to £64,000 if paid by 2 September 2020 to promote compliance with the PECR.

More specifically, the spokesperson outlined, "People expect that they can keep their personal lives private and that they are also entitled to a degree of privacy in the workplace [...] If organisations wish to monitor their employees, they should be clear about its purpose and that it brings real benefits. Organisations also need to make employees aware of the nature, extent and reasons for any monitoring."The European Commission ('the Commission') and the U.S. Department of Commerce ('DoC') issued, on 10 August 2020, a joint statement announcing that they had initiated discussions to evaluate the potential for an enhanced EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework to comply with the Court Justice of the European Union's ('CJEU') judgment in Data Protection Commissioner v. Facebook Ireland Limited, Maximillian Schrems (C-311/18) ('the Schrems II Case').

In particular, Datatilsynet highlighted that the IB grades were not correct because they did not reflect individual academic ability, thereby leading to discrimination, and that the processing was not in line with the reasonable expectations of data subjects, thus contradicting the fairness principle of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In addition, Datatilsynet noted that the processing taking place through this grading system may lead to denial of opportunities for students and that, in this case, it has adversely affected students in an undue and unjustifiable manner. On this basis, Datatilsynet gave the IBO the opportunity to submit its comments to the Order by 14 August 2020 and stated that, following these comments, a final decision will be taken.

In particular, the FCC highlighted that consumer data is being aggregated and monetised for advertisement placement purposes, and that this data is being used to track consumers' locations to protests and places of worship. In this respect, the FCC noted that Starks is seeking information into AT&T and Verizon's participation in real-time bidding exchanges for mobile advertising, and is requesting details on each provider's policies and procedures to prohibit or minimise tracking of consumers. Specifically the FCC outlined that the letters sent to the service providers ask, among other things, the companies to explain their participation in monetising or using customer data intended for advertising placement to advance non-advertising objectives, to quantify the amount of US location data distributed in real-time bidding processes, and to detail policies in place to minimise, destroy, or prohibit the tracking of consumers according to their data.

The FCC noted that this follows a bipartisan group of members of the U.S. Congress sending a letter on the same to the Federal Trade Commission ('FTC'), requesting an investigation into such practices.

In particular, the update of the Standard aims to allow the Health Data Hub, under certain conditions, to access the relevant personal data in the context of processing activities which present a low risk for impact on the right to privacy. Specifically, the Standard specifies that access conditions include processing activities carried out for the purposes of research, study or analysis in the health sector, which serve the public interest, and for which access to the EGB, SNIIRAM or the related datamarts is necessary. In addition, the Standard highlights that, for such specific purposes of processing, neither the opinion of the Committee for Research, Study and Analysis in the health sector ('CESREES') nor authorisation from CNIL will need to be obtained.

Furthermore, the Standard has been updated with, among other things, a list of purposes for processing which can benefit from the new and simplified procedure, which includes changes in care, comparative analysis of treatment, description and analysis of patient pathologies and treatment plans. Moreover, the Standard adds that manufacturers and insurance providers working in the health sector can also benefit from the simplified access procedure, although they are required to collaborate with laboratories. Lastly, the Standard details that, where necessary, the period for which data can be accessed may be extended once for a maximum period of 24 months.

In particular, the LfDI Rheinland-Pfalz highlighted that not only does the contact tracing data collection allow conclusions to be drawn about the leisure time and consumer behavior of visitors and customers, the lists have recently come under fire due to isolated access by the police authorities. The Law would include purpose limitation regulations, use bans, and special rules for criminal prosecution, which can only access the contact data collected for the purpose of infection protection in the event of serious criminal offenses and under the condition of procedural guarantees, such as judicial decisions. Finally, the LfDI Rheinland-Pfalz stated that legal security and the protection of liberty are fundamental requirements of an accepted and thus successful infection protection.

In particular, the Blogpost explains that, for specific issues, quantum computers have a speed advantage over classical computers and outlines, among other things, the implications of quantum computing for data protection in terms of data security and confidentiality of communications. More specifically, the Blogpost notes that quantum computing can break cryptography, thus, undermining IT security and also affecting core internet security protocols. In addition, the Blogpost highlights that quantum-safe cryptography which will not be affected by quantum computers, is not yet standardised and that, currently, until the transition to quantum-safe cryptography, organisations should consider for how long they need to ensure absolute confidentiality of data and protection from retrospective decryption.

In particular, the CPLT noted that SUBTEL had sent a letter to companies requesting the delivery of customer data in order to carry out an opinion study, and secondly, that a company, after being awarded a tender for a technical standard for the provision of internet access and a minimum speed of internet, will be responsible for collecting user information through software that the company can install on cell phones or computers to measure speed, and which will collect and deliver individuals' data to SUBTEL.

In this respect, the CPLT outlined that the principles of necessity and proportionality must be respected, and only the necessary data for the intended purposes should be collected and used for those purposes only, in accordance with Law No. 19.628 on the Protection of Private Life 1999 ('the Law'). Moreover, the CPLT further urged compliance with international standards and norms on the same, and highlighted the new legal initiative under discussion in Parliament, which would modernise the Law and resolve gaps in the current legal framework.

In particular, the HmbBfDI noted that local data protection authorities are generally not able to monitor cases in which the massive amounts of data that is stored in reserve is used as an aid in the fulfillment of the tasks of the law enforcement authorities, as there is often a lack of knowledge about the cases of change of purpose. Furthermore, the HmbBfDI outlined that the possibility that law enforcement authorities use this data for their own purposes is largely unrestricted by the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Federal Data Protection Act of 30 June 2017 (implementing the GDPR) and that corresponding data processing, insofar as it is carried out to determine or punish criminal offences or administrative offences, must comply with the principle of proportionality.

Facebook Ireland Limited, Maximillian Schrems (C-311/18) ('the Schrems II Case'). In particular, the OPCNZ highlighted that the decision in the Schrems II Case does not directly affect personal data transfers between the EU and New Zealand because these transfers are conducted on the basis of the existing adequacy decision which has been in place since 2012. However, the OPCNZ noted that the influence of the decision on international data transfers is likely to be significant and will have an impact on the international framework for data flows. In addition, the OPCNZ outlined that it will take the decision in the Schrems II Case into consideration when developing model contract clauses under the Privacy Act 2020, which includes new limits on international transfers of personal information under information privacy principle 12.

In particular, the UODO highlighted that the processing was contrary to Article 6(1)(c) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), as the legal acts regulating the principles of the functioning of educational institutions do not specify such tasks and obligations. However, the UODO noted that a reprimand was sufficient at this stage, as the school took immediate corrective actions such as destroying the questionnaire forms and organising employee training to raise awareness of the protection of personal data.

You can read the press release here and the Decision here, both only available in Polish.The Danish data protection authority ('Datatilsynet') issued, on 5 August 2020, its decision ('the Decision') stating that it is permissible under the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') for an unnamed company to process fingerprint information for the purpose of uniquely identifying employees, following consultation with the Data Council. In particular, the Datatilsynet highlighted that a trade union had complained on behalf of one of its members that a company processes information about fingerprints with a view to unambiguously identifying which employee is approaching and leaving the workplace. Furthermore, the Decision outlines that one of the council members did not believe that the Datatilsynet was competent to deal with the issue, as the matter is covered by the Danish Employers' Confederation and the Danish Trade Union Confederation ('the DA/LO Agreement') on control measures, so the member believed that the trade union system was the right forum.

In the Decision, the Datatilsynet highlighted that the company stated that this was a control measure which had been notified in accordance with the main agreement between the DA/LO Agreement. Furthermore, the Datatilsynet noted that the company justified the control measure on the grounds that it is crucial for food safety, including the company's export opportunities, that unauthorised persons do not gain access to the production site and that it can be identified at any time who has participated in the production of a given product. Moreover, the Datatilsynet outlined in the Decision that key tags that employees scan do not provide sufficient assurance that it can be unambiguously identified who has been present in the production, as there may be theft of key tags or replacement of key tags, both incorrectly and intentionally. In addition, the Datatilsynet emphasised that the system does not store images of the individual's fingerprint, but a unique template based on the fingerprint. Specifically, the scanner is designed so that data in the scanner, should it fall into the wrong hands, could not be used without a copy of the associated database, and that the database is located on a server at the group's head office that only the IT department's employees have access to via a separate coding system. Furthermore, the Datatilsynet noted that non-employees do not have access to the company's PCs, and that the information in the system can only be accessed by the few employees who have a work-related need for this, which only includes the IT department and the group's payroll office.

After an overall review, the Datatilsynet found that there was no basis for overriding the company's assessment as the processing could therefore take place in accordance with Article 5 of the GDPR and Section 12(1) of Act No. 502 of 23 May 2018 on Supplementary Provisions to the Regulation on the Protection of Natural Persons with Regard to the Processing of Personal Data and on the Free Movement of Such Data.

Futhermore, the purchase was made using the claimants personal and banking details to obtain prepaid Lycamobile cards. Moreover, as Vodafone España agreed to a voluntary payment, the fine was reduced to €48,000.

You can read the press release, only available in Spanish, here.The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman ('the Ombudsman') announced, on 05 August 2020, that the Sanctions Chamber of the Ombudsman ('the Sanctions Chamber'), had issued a decision ('the Decision') in which it had fined Independent Consulting Oy (Acc Consulting Varsinais-Suomi) €7,000 for sending electronic direct marketing messages without prior consent and for non-compliance with the data subject rights. In particular, the Decision relates to 11 complaints received by the Ombudsman relating to the company's direct electronic marketing and non-exercise of data subject rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In addition, the Sanctions Chamber held that the company could not rely on the defence that it had conducted targeted electronic direct marketing to entities which do not require consent under the Act on Electronic Communications Services (917/2014), as the company had not conducted any assessments prior to the marketing considering, among other things, the recipient's job.

Moreover, the Decision notes that some of the complaints concerned the fact that data subjects had made requests to the controller for their rights under the GDPR and that the controller had not responded to the requests as required without undue delay and within a maximum of one month of receipt of the request. In addition, the Decision highlights that the controller did not appear to have organised its procedures for processing personal data in such a way that it can indicate whether it had exercised the data subjects' rights or received requests for rights and that therefore was unable to demonstrate that it had processed personal data lawfully.

Lastly, the Decision outlines that the Deputy Ombudsman of the Office also obliges the controller to rectify its conduct with regard to direct marketing and has ordered the company to change its practices and exercise the data subject's rights in accordance with the GDPR.

You can read the press release here.The French data protection authority ('CNIL') announced, on 5 August 2020, its decision ('the Decision') issued on 28 July 2020 to impose a €250,000 fine on Spartoo SAS for violating multiple provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In particular, the Decision outlines that Spartoo breached the principle of data minimisation under Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR, retained the data for longer than was necessary under Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR, as well as failed to abide by the obligation to inform under Article 13 of the GDPR, and to take adequate measures to ensure the security of data as required by Article 32 of the GDPR. More specifically, in light of the purposes of processing data for employee training and fraud prevention, CNIL considered that the permanent recording of telephone calls with customer service employees, the recording of customer bank details, and the collection of customers' health cards were excessive and, thus, contrary to data minimisation.

In addition, CNIL found that the Spartoo had not set up a retention period for customer and prospect data, and also did not regularly erase and archive personal data. Moreover, CNIL held that retaining, for a period exceeding five years, names and passwords in a non-anonymised form to enable customers to re-use their account contradicted Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR. Moreover, CNIL held that customers were misinformed about the legal bases for the data processing and that employees had not been adequately informed about the purpose behind the processing, the recipients of the data, the data retention period, and their rights, which meant that Spartoo breached its obligation to provide information under Article 13 of the GPDR. Lastly, CNIL noted that Spartoo had not used adequately strong passwords for accessing customer accounts and, thus, failed to ensure the security of data processed by the company as required by Article 32 of the GDPR.

Therefore, CNIL, also taking into account the three million clients and 25 million prospects affected, as well as the retention of bank data, imposed a €250,000 fine on Spartoo and asked that it brings its processing in conformity with the GDPR within three months of the notification of the Decision.

In particular, the Findings note that the complaint highlighted TD's decision to outsource aspects of its fraud claims processing services to a third-party service provider in India and that TD did not obtain consent for, or allow customers to opt-out of, the transfer of personal information to a service provider in a foreign jurisdiction.

In this respect, the Findings outline that the third-party service provider was using TD customers' information to manage fraud claims for TD and that TD was not required to obtain separate consent for or to provide customers the choice to opt-out of, the transfer of personal information to the third-party service provider for that same purpose. In addition, the Findings highlight that TD was sufficiently open about this transfer, provided customers with information pertaining to its transfers, and also made this information available through its privacy resources, as well as had been accountable with respect to the information it transferred and ensured a comparable level of protection for that information.

In particular, the Letter outlines the view that the FTC does not function as an effective privacy agency and that the U.S. Congress should establish an independent data protection agency, with the Senate Commerce Committee instead scheduling a hearing on Senate Bill 3300 to establish a Federal data protection agency. Specifically, the Letter notes three key points for the Senate Commerce Committee's consideration in this respect, highlighting the FTC's failure to stop mergers that threaten consumer privacy, the FTC's failure to establish data protection standards as it cannot enforce its own consent orders, and the general need for a US data protection agency because of the lacking authority and expertise of the FTC.

In particular, the Datatilsynet noted that PrivatBo, a management company, assisted a housing fund with the intended sale of three properties, and that PrivatBo had provided material for the properties in question, which was distributed to the occupants of the properties in a total of 424 USB keys. However, PrivatBo was not aware that for some of the leases handed out, documents were attached which contained personal data of a confidential nature and which should not have been disclosed. Therefore, the Datatilsynet chose to report PrivatBo to the police for the unintentional transfer of personal information that took place as part of the handing over of the 424 USB keys.

In addition, the Datatilsynet found grounds for expressing serious criticism that PrivatBo subsequently, in connection with the same offer obligation, unintentionally distributed information relating to outstanding deposits and prepaid rent, and in some cases information on disbursements in deposits, to residents in a property other than that which was subject to the obligation in question. The unintentional disclosure of this information occurred despite the fact that PrivatBo had hired an external auditing company.

In particular, the OPCNZ highlighted that in Taylor v Chief Executive of the Department of Corrections ([2018] NZHRRT 35, the High Court noted that Mr Taylor's personal information appeared on the same pages as the names of Corrections Officers which did not constitute personal information, and therefore did not need to be disclosed under the Act because it was essentially administrative information. Furthermore, the High Court clarified that the information regarding the Corrections Officers did not automatically become Mr Taylor's information, it appeared on the same page as his personal information because it was still possible to distinguish and redact their names from the personal information about Mr Taylor without making the substantive content of the documents unintelligible. As such, the OPCNZ highlighted that when deciding whether third party information can be treated as 'mixed information,' an agency should consider whether the information is 'essentially administrative' and if the redactions of information would render the communications unintelligible. In addition, the OPCNZ confirmed that if an agency determines that the names or details of another individual are not the personal information of the requester, then the agency should not assess or withhold this information under the Act.

You can read the statement, only available in Polish, here.Insurance Europe announced, on 3 August 2020, that it had published an insight briefing ('the Insight Briefing') about the European insurance industry's views on artificial intelligence ('AI'). Furthermore, Insurance Europe outlined three challenges in maximising the benefit for both consumers and themselves in their use of AI. Firstly, Insurance Europe noted that when developing AI systems, insurers face restricted access to data from the public sector, and stated that, for maximum societal benefit, such datasets should be available for free and in a machine-readable format. In addition, Insurance Europe highlighted that the non-personal data for some AI applications is also sometimes concentrated in the hands of a few entities, resulting in restricted or expensive access to data that could improve AI systems and better serve customers.

Insurance Europe further noted in the Insight Briefing that insurers would like to see a holistic approach to regulation. Moreover, Insurance Europe stated that the EU legal framework already covers areas relevant to AI such as fundamental rights, privacy, and data protection, as well as product safety and liability, which is then complemented by national regulatory frameworks. To support the development and uptake of AI, and to avoid unnecessary regulatory burdens, Insurance Europe noted that a horizontal, proportionate, and principles-based AI regulatory framework is needed that builds on existing EU and national regulatory frameworks. Insurance Europe also opined that there is currently a lack of effective collaboration between authorities with responsibilities in the field of digitalisation and that there is a need for all national authorities, whether they are responsible for the conduct of business, prudential regulation, competition, or data protection, to work closely together and ensure consistency in applying the rules to further develop the digital single market.

Furthermore, Insurance Europe stipulated that new EU rules for AI are only required if there are gaps in existing legislation, and for this reason, European (re)insurers do not support the creation of a civil liability regime for the use of AI because developing any kind of strict liability and compulsory insurance scheme for AI would not work. In addition, as Insurance Europe noted in the Insight Briefing, the conditions for mandatory insurance, which include sufficient similarity in the risks being covered and sufficient data on the risks, are not met. Moreover, Insurance Europe called for existing legislation to be reviewed to see if it creates barriers to AI, for example, further guidance on the application of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). Finally, Insurance Europe called for the deployment of ethical, trustworthy, and human-centric AI via an appropriate, risk-based, and proportionate regulatory framework. The scope of the framework should be targeted only at those AI applications with proven high risk and significant effects on the rights of individuals, as not all uses of AI pose significant risks or directly impact consumers. In the context of financial services legislation, and insurance, in particular, principles such as transparency, fairness, accountability, and ethics are to some extent already addressed by rules on the conduct of business and disclosure, while rules on advice apply whether the recommendation is provided by a human or by AI.

In particular, the Guidance presents an initial step toward understanding the security challenges in cloud systems by analysing the access control considerations in the three cloud service delivery models, namely Infrastructure as a Service ('IaaS'), Platform as a Service ('PaaS'), and Software as a Service ('SaaS'). Specifically, the Guidance summarises, among other things, essential characteristics that would affect the cloud's access control design, including broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, measured service, and data sharing, as well as proposes guidance and recommendations for access control design of IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS in order to facilitate future implementations for such systems.

You can read the press release here and the Guidance here.The European Banking Authority ('EBA') launched, on 31 July 2020, a public consultation aimed at revising its guidelines on internal governance for credit institutions. In particular, the draft guidelines on internal governance under Directive (EU) 2013/36/EU on access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms ('the Draft Guidelines') highlight that internal governance includes all standards and principles concerned with setting credit institutions' objectives, strategies and risk management frameworks. Furthermore, the Draft Guidelines outline that combatting money laundering and terrorist financing is essential for maintaining stability and integrity in the financial system. In addition, the Draft Guidelines note that credit institutions should avoid setting up non-transparent structures and undertake a risk assessment to ensure that such structures are not connected with money laundering, terrorist financing or other financial crimes. Moreover, the Draft Guidelines include rules on internal alert procedures and whistleblowing, and state that such procedures must ensure the protection of the personal data of persons reporting the breach and persons allegedly responsible of the breach in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR').

The deadline for submission of comments is 31 October 2020.

In particular, the ADDC highlighted that taking a national approach would ensure consistency and interoperability across jurisdictions on digital identity verification, support the ability for commonly held digital identities to be re-used across jurisdictions, and enhance the experience for individuals and businesses interacting with government and across government boundaries.

You can read the press release here.The Spanish data protection authority ('AEPD') issued, on 31 July 2020, a statement ('the Statement') addressing the collection of personal data by entertainment venues in the context of the COVID-19 ('Coronavirus') pandemic. In particular, the AEPD held that although personal data is collected in order to trace the infection of Coronavirus, such data is not classified as sensitive personal data. Moreover, the AEPD highlighted that if consent is used as a legal basis for data processing, no negative consequences, such as the prevention of entry, could be imposed to persons that do not want to provide consent. In addition, the AEPD found that a mandatory obligation to provide personal data can be based on a legal obligation and Article 6(1)(e) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') as it would be justified by the public interest. Furthermore, the AEPD found that health authorities should assess in which public spaces it is necessary to impose a mandatory identification requirement, taking into account whether there could be more moderate measures and the specificities of the sphere, highlighting among other things, nightclubs and museums.

Finally, the AEPD held that the principle of data minismisation must be respected and that it can sometimes be sufficient to obtain a telephone number to trace an infection. The AEPD found that identification through a national identiy card is always unnecessary because it is considered to be disproportionate.

In particular, the OPC and IPC noted that they support the use of the App as it had now met all the privacy principles previously highlighted in a joint statement on COVID-19 ('Coronavirus') contact tracing apps, which included principles of consent and trust, necessity and proportionality, purpose limitation, de-identification, time limitation, transparency, accountability, and safeguards. Specifically, the OPC and IPC highlighted, among other things, that use of the App is voluntary and has been developed with robust safeguards to protect user identities, and although there is still a risk that third parties may seek to compel the disclosure of information on individuals' use of the App, the OPC and IPC have undertaken to communicate publicly that individuals should not be required to use the App or to disclose information about their use.

Facebook Ireland Limited, Maximillian Schrems (C-311/18). In particular, the ITA noted that the judgment does not relieve participants in the Privacy Shield of their obligations under the framework and that the US remains committed to working with the EU to ensure continuity in transatlantic data flows and privacy protections. Furthermore, the ITA highlighted that the continued participation in the Privacy Shield demonstrates a serious commitment to protect personal information and that it continues to administer the program, including processing submissions for self-certification and re-certification to the Privacy Shield and maintaining the Privacy Shield List.

Facebook Ireland Limited, Maximillian Schrems (C-311/18) ('the Schrems II Case'). In particular, the Letter welcomes the CJEU's upholding of Standard Contractual Clauses ('SCCs') as a valid transfer mechanism, and goes on to encourage the US and EU governments to work together to ensure that companies can fully and safely rely on data transfer mechanisms, as well as to ensure the long-term viability of SCCs in order to avoid legal uncertainty and economic harm. In addition, the Letter notes the importance of EU data protection authorities providing guidance to companies that were using Privacy Shield to transfer data in order to allow them to continue business operations until a successor agreement is reached.

You can read the press release here and the Letter here.The Information Commissioner ('the Commissioner') issued, on 30 July 2020, a statement reiterating the inadequate legal basis for the operation of the mobile application ('the App') for informing people about contact with those infected of COVID-19 ('Coronavirus'). In particular, the Commissioner highlighted that the Data Protection Impact Assessment ('DPIA') carried out in respect of the data processing through the App does not remedy the serious deficiencies in the law and the risks arising from the ambiguities as to whether there is a clear and constitutional legal basis for the processing of personal data related to the operation of the App. In addition, the Commissioner emphasised that such a high risk cannot be mitigated by organisational measures alone, and noted that the mere fact that the use of contact tracing applications is voluntary does not mean that the processing of personal data will be based on consent, as is the case of public authorities providing a service by delegation, where the most relevant legal basis for processing would be that processing is necessary for the performance of a task in the public interest, as provided under Article 6(1)(e) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR').

You can read the statement, only available in Slovenian, here.The Danish data protection authority ('Datatilsynet') issued, on 31 July 2020, its decision ('the Decision') expressing serious criticism of the Region of Southern Denmark for failing to conduct the necessary risk assessment and testing during the development of an IT system, which led to the unauthorised access of pregnant women's names, social security numbers, and information regarding the pregnancy in violation of Articles 32(1), 33(5), and 34(2) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). Moreover, the Datatilsynet noted that the Region of Southern Denmark had reported a breach of personal data security, and that the Decision had been on the basis of a lack of risk assessment of processing, a lack of measures regarding development and testing, a lack of timely documentation of the circumstances of the breach, and deficiencies in the notification to data subjects.

In particular, the Datatilsynet highlighted that in the notification to the data subjects, the Region of Southern Denmark had only stated that names and social security numbers had been exposed, despite the fact that information on pregnancy could also be deduced from the exposed information and the context in which the information was included. Furthermore, the Datatilsynet noted that because the data controller must document data breaches, avoid similar breaches in the future, and possibly inform the affected data subjects, it is essential for GDPR compliance that the data controller has mechanisms that ensure knowledge of the incidents, and that it can recognise and document an understanding of the circumstances of the breach.

In particular, the ANSPDCP highlighted that the operator had not provided the applicant with information on the actions taken following the request within one month (or up to three months if a reason for the delay is provided). In addition, the ANSPDCP noted the obligation, under Article 12(3) of the GDPR, to respond to data subject requests without undue delay and at the latest within one month from the receipt of the request. Therefore, the ANSPDCP requested that the company respond to the data subject request.

In particular, NAV announced that under the amended VAT Act, the monetary condition for the obligation to provide information is abolished and that all invoices issued by a taxable person to another domestic taxable person for a domestic transaction (excluding intra-community supplies of goods), regardless of the VAT content of the invoice, must be reported to NAV. Moreover, NAV announced that because the COVID-19 ('Coronavirus') emergency situation prevented taxpayers to adequately prepare for the new legal obligation, it will grant a transition period at least until 30 September 2020, during which it will not impose a penalty if the taxpayer fails to fulfil their obligation to provide the required account data.

The NAV issued, on 8 July 2020, an additional Statement ('the Additional Statement') highlighting that the amendments of the VAT Act require that the first eight digits of the tax number of the person purchasing a product or using a service must be indicated on the invoice issued for a domestic transaction. However, NAV stressed that this is only necessary if a person subject to VAT acquires a product or uses a service, and held that an invoice can therefore continue to be issued without a customer tax number if the person acquiring the product and using the service is not a VAT payer. Furthermore, the NAV provided examples for situations in which the requirements do not apply such as a national or foreign private person or an international organisation.

Finally, NAV held that if a customer who purchases the product and uses a service declares, orally or in writing, that they do not have a tax number or are not subject to VAT in a specific transaction, the invoice does not have to include a customer tax number.

In particular, the EFF highlighted that the CPRA does not do enough to advance the data privacy of California consumers as it is a mixed bag of partial steps backwards and forwards and includes some but not most of the strengthening amendments urged by privacy advocates. Furthermore, the EFF outlined that the CPRA would expand 'pay for privacy' schemes, erode the right to delete personal information, provide weaker biometric privacy, and not empower consumers to sue businesses that violate privacy rights. However, the EFF noted that the CPRA also provides for an opt-out right for sensitive information and data sharing and also expands the private right of action in relation to data breaches.

You can read the statement here.The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of New Zealand ('OPCNZ') released, on 30 July 2020, a statement welcoming the findings of an investigation into the COVID-19 ('Coronavirus') patient privacy breach. In particular, the OPCNZ highlighted that a confidential list of details including the names, dates of birth, ages, and quarantine locations of 18 active confirmed cases of Coronavirus had been leaked. Furthermore, the OPCNZ outlined that the Privacy Act 1993 ('the Act') and the Health Information Privacy Code 1994 both include exceptions for the disclosure of information where necessary to prevent or lessen a serious threat to public health. However, the OPCNZ noted that the findings of the investigation, which were that the motivations behind each disclosure, had been political.

Privacy Commissioner, John Edwards, stated, ''The State Services Commission has referred the report to my office to consider what further action, if any, under the Act is appropriate. [However], the Privacy Commissioner has no ability to issue penalties against individuals or organisations and has no jurisdiction over Members of Parliament. It remains open to any of the individuals whose information was subject to the breaches to make complaints to my office.''

You can read the press release here.The European Data Protection Board ('EDPB') published, on 28 July 2020, a letter ('the Letter') in response to questions from Sophie in ‘t Veld, Olivier Chastel, Moritz Körner, Maite Pagazaurtundúa, Michal Šimečka, and Ramona Strugariu, members of the European Parliament ('MEPs'), on the possible expansion of the Prüm framework. In particular, the Letter recalls that the EDPB has not been consulted, formally or informally, by the Council of the European Union or the European Commission on this matter. However, the Letter outlines that it is essential that the Prüm framework undergoes a comprehensive and independent evaluation with regard to its compliance with the current data protection acquis, prior to any envisioned expansion or amendment.

In addition, the Letter highlights that whether the Prüm legal framework may be expanded to include retrospective facial recognition, in line with EU law, would depend on the details of the possible expansion and data protection safeguards foreseen. Moreover, the Letter states that the addition of retrospective facial recognition for the purpose of identifying a person within the Prüm legal framework would require a dedicated legal basis under EU law, as well as a thorough impact assessment, in order to ensure that the necessity and proportionality of such measure, and the essence of the fundamental right to data protection are respected.

Finally, the Letter reminds that the EDPB stands ready to provide further in-depth guidance, should a legislative proposal be envisioned, as well as that it will prepare guidelines on the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement authorities.
