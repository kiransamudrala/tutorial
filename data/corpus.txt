 The Agency for Personal Data Protection in Bosnia and Herzegovina ('AZLP') published, on 10 August 2020, an opinion ('the Opinion') on the measurement of body temperature of workers, clients and minors when entering certain premises such as workplaces, restaurants and schools. In particular, the AZLP delivered the Opinion further to a request as to whether, among other things, employers are entitled to subject their employees to temperature checks, rather than refer them for medical examination, and whether the consent of workers constitutes a valid legal basis for the processing of their body temperature. More specifically, the AZLP noted that measuring the body temperature of a person entering specific premises without the identification of the person does not constitute processing of personal data and, thus, does not fall under the scope of the Law on the Protection of Personal Data No. 49/06 ('the PDPL'). In addition, the AZLP highlighted that the measurement of temperature is a preventive measure with the legitimate aim of preventing the spread of COVID-19 ('Coronavirus'), as well as that the implementation of this measure should be communicated prior to measuring the temperature of individuals.

In particular, a CNIL spokesperson said, "To date, CNIL is continuing its investigations and is participating in the European work in progress [...] At this stage, the main points of attention noted by CNIL are also the issues of information for individuals, the way in which rights are exercised, flows outside the EU, and the measures taken with regard to minors, for whom the application is very popular."  In addition, the spokesperson noted, "After investigation, the complainant was invited to exercise their rights with TikTok under the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), a step that they had not taken beforehand."  Lastly, the spokesperson highlighted, "The investigations could eventually fall under the sole responsibility of the Irish [Data Protection Commission ('DPC')], which will have to deal with the case in cooperation with the other European data protection authorities. In order to fall under the sole competence of the [DPC] and not under the competence of each of the authorities, TikTok will nevertheless have to prove that its establishment in Ireland meets the conditions of a 'principal place of business' within the meaning of the GDPR."

 The State Commissioner for Data Protection and Access to Information Brandenburg ('Brandenburg LDA') published, on 11 August 2020, a study on how the gastronomy sector in Brandenburg deals with the data of their guests which they are obliged to collect during the COVID-19 ('Coronavirus') pandemic. In particular, Brandenburg LDA stated that it investigated 54 restaurants and noticed that an excessive amount of data categories were recorded in 30 restaurant establishments. In addition, Brandenburg LDA noticed that the address of visitors, which is no longer required according to the current legislation, was often asked, and that many restaurants did not recognise that only one of the telephone number and email address of visitors should be given.  Moreover, Brandenburg LDA found that 36 cafes and restaurants did not adhere to the deletion deadlines, that 16 of them had not deleted any data, and that the confidential handling of guest data was not always guaranteed. Furthermore, Brandenburg LDA stated that during their discussions, it had the impression that there was often uncertainty as to how the data should be handled.  Finally, Brandenburg LDA highlighted that under the current legisltation, restaurants must, among other things, record the contact details of their guests in an attendance list but that the first and last name and the telephone number or email address of the person concerned are sufficient. In addition, Brandenburg LDA highlighted that the data must be kept confidential and deleted after four weeks.

In particular, key findings of the Repository include the fact that local authorities have drawn heavily on data-driven technology to support the education sector and that the majority of the use-cases arise in the healthcare and digital sectors. In addition, the Repository indicates that there has been an increase of data sharing between organisations, both public and private, and highlights that this could present implications for the privacy of data subjects, which local authorities will need to carefully consider. 
 The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of New Zealand ('OPCNZ') released, on 12 August 2020, a report on its inquiry into Trade Me Ltd.'s privacy policy ('the Report'). In particular, the Report highlights that Trade Me had failed to take all reasonable steps to ensure that its members were aware of the purposes for which their information was being collected and how their preference to opt-out of targeted marketing would be given effect. Furthermore, Report outlines that many users believed that the option to opt-out acted as a limitation on the ability of Trade Me to target its own advertisements to members. However, the Report notes that while Trade Me's operational practice was inconsistent with what it maintains was the intent and scope of its policy, its practice was consistent with how many members expected the opt-out to work, and that the 2018 opt-out and privacy policy update brought Trade Me's policy in line with its operational practice.  In addition, the Report includes a number of recommendations for businesses that want to make changes to their terms and conditions or privacy policies, such as considering the substance and clarity of what users have been told about how their information will be used and whether the new use is consistent or directly related to that which the individual has been informed of.

 The National Privacy Commission ('NPC') issued, on 12 August 2020, a statement reiterating that the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10173) ('the Data Privacy Act') is not a hinderance to contact tracing initiatives, highlighting that the Data Privacy Act seeks to protect individuals from discrimination, harassment, and acts of social vigilantism amid the COVID-19 ('Coronavirus') pandemic. In particular, the NPC clarified that the Data Privacy Act does not prevent hospitals from sharing a patient's data to proper authorities. In addition, the NPC noted that hospitals are mandated to collect information from patients and provide it to the authorities under the guidelines set by the Department of Health. Moreover, the NPC stated that it has provided public health emergency bulletings and advisory opinions as guidance for personal information controllers, especially healthcare providers. 
 The Government Accountability Office ('GAO') released, on 11 August 2020, its report ('the Report') on privacy and accuracy issues related to the commercial use of facial recognition technology. In particular, the Report examines, among other things, how companies use facial recognition technology, the varying degrees of accuracy across demographic groups, and how privacy issues are addressed in laws and industry practices. Specifically, the Report finds, among other things, that although the accuracy of facial recognition technology has increased, differences in performance exist for certain demographic groups, and with respect to privacy, the main concerns are that individuals are unable to remain anonymous in public, technology is used without individuals' consent, and such technology may collect or store facial images which poses additional risks. As such, the Report reiterates recommendations made in previous reports, suggesting that the U.S. Congress should consider strengthening the consumer privacy framework to reflect changes in technology and the marketplace.

 The Greek Supreme Court issued, on 15 July 2020, a judgment on data controllers' obligation to inform data subjects about the processing of their data by banks and the subsequent transfer of their data to debt collection societies. In particular, the plaintiff had taken a loan from the Bank EFG Eurobank A.E. and, further to their delay in repaying the loan, Eurobank transferred the plaintiff's personal data, including the amount of their debt, their name and telephone number, to Eurobank Remedial Services without previously informing them about such transfer. More specifically, Eurobank argued that, by completing an application for a loan, the plaintiff had been informed and had given their clear consent to the processing of their personal data by Eurobank as well as to the disclosure of such data to companies collaborating with Eurobank. The Supreme Court noted that, while the plaintiff was previously informed about the transfer of its data to debt collection societies and Eurobank Remedial Services was not a debt collection society, by providing this information to the plaintiff through the loan application, Eurobank had satisfied the requirements of Article 11 on the right to be informed of Law No. 2472/1997, which was the pre- General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') law. Thus, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Eurobank. 
 The Court of Appeal (Civil Division) ('the Court of Appeal') issued, on 11 August 2020, its judgment in R (on the application of Edward Bridges) (Appellant) v The Chief Constable of South Wales Police (Respondent) & others [2020] EWCA Civ 1058, overturning the previous decision of the High Court of Justice. In particular, the Court of Appeal ruled that the High Court erred in concluding that South Wales Police's ('SWP') interference with Bridges' rights under Article 8(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights ('ECHR') was in accordance with the law under Article 8(2) of the ECHR. Specifically, the Court of Appeal held that although the legal framework comprised primary legislation (Data Protection Act 2018 ('the Act')), secondary legislation (the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice), and local policies promulgated by SWP, there was no clear guidance on where the specific type of the automated facial recognition technology could be used and who could be put on a watchlist.  As a result, the Court of Appeal held that this was too broad a discretion to afford to the police officers to meet the standard required by Article 8(2) of the ECHR. In addition, the Court of Appeal held that the SWP failed to provide an adequate Data Protection Impact Assessment ('DPIA'), as required under Section 64 of the Act, and found that as the DPIA was written on the basis that Article 8 was not infringed, the DPIA was deficient.   UPDATE (11 August 2020)  ICO welcomes Court of Appeal's judgment  The Information Commissioner's Office ('ICO') issued, on 11 August 2020, a statement, welcoming the Court of Appeal's judgment which provides clarification on the police use of live facial recognition technology in public places. In particular, the ICO stated that the judgment is a useful step towards providing a clear legal framework relating to how the police use surveillance technology. 
 The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ('FINRA') announced, on 10 August 2020, along with the Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') and the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission ('CFTC') enforcement action totalling $38M for anti-money laundering ('AML') failures against Interactive Brokers LLC. In particular, FINRA stated that it had fined Interactive Brokers $15 million for widespread failures in the firm's AML program and noted that part of the settlement - the FINRA Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent ('the FINRA AWC') - requires Interactive Brokers to certify that it will implement the recommendations of a third-party consultant to remedy the failures.  In addition, the SEC Order finds that Interactive Brokers violated the financial recordkeeping and reporting provision of the federal securities laws and a related SEC rule and, as a result, fines Interactive Brokers $11.5 million. Finally, the CFTC action charging Interactive Brokers $11.5 million for a violation of Regulation 42.2. (requiring registrants to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970) marks the first enforcement action of its kind.  Jessica Hopper, FINRA Executive Vice President and Head of Enforcement, stated, "Today's action is a reminder that member firms must tailor their AML programs to the firms' business model and customer base, and also dedicate resources to programs commensurate with their growth and business lines. FINRA will continue to take steps to ensure that firms comply with their obligation to monitor for, detect and report suspicious activity."  You can read the FINRA press release here and the FINRA AWC here, the SEC press release here and SEC Order here, and the CFTC press release here.
 The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman announced, on 11 August 2020, that the Deputy Data Protection Ombudsman ('the Deputy Ombudsman'), had ordered Euroclear Finland Oy to modify its shareholder register disclosure activities to ensure compliance with data protection requirements. In particular, the Deputy Ombudsman noted that the company was disclosing, via telephone and for direct marketing purposes, information obtained from a shareholder register of limited companies and cooperatives and highlighted that, as Euroclear independently decided upon the disclosure of the data, it constituted a controller instead of a processor. In addition, the Deputy Ombudsman held that the use of the telephone was not one of the lawful methods for disclosing information of shareholders and, thus, the processing was not fair as required by the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). Moreover, the Deputy Ombudsman considered that Euroclear had a duty to inform data subjects about the disclosure of data for direct marketing purposes, and that merely mentioning direct marketing on a website is not sufficient to ensure that the data subjects have exercised their right to object to the processing of personal data for direct marketing. Therefore, the Deputy Ombudsman ordered Euroclear to change its shareholder register disclosure practices to ensure compliance with data protection requirements. 
 The Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') announced, on 6 August 2020, that World Acceptance Corporation ('WAC'), had agreed to pay $21.7 million to resolve charges that it had violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 1977 ('FCPA'). In particular, the SEC Order ('the Order') states that, from at least December 2010 to June 2017, WAC's former Mexican subsidiary made bribes totalling $4 million to Mexican government and union officials to secure the ability to make loans to government employees and ensure that said loans were paid in a timely manner. Furthermore, the Order details that WAC's subsidiary lacked internal accounting controls sufficient to detect or prevent the payments of such bribes and that the management lacked the appropriate tone in relation to internal audit and compliance. Moreover, in the Order, it is specified that WAC has consented to the Order, which requires WAC to cease and desist from violating the anti-bribery, books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA. 
 The Danish data protection authority ('Datatilsynet') announced, on 10 August 2020, that it had updated its guidance ('the Guidance') on records of processing activities under Article 30 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In particular, Datatilsynet highlighted that the Guidance has been updated to clarify that a list of processing activities must state which categories of data subjects the information in question relates to, and must additionally contain a clear link between the categories of personal data processed and the individual categories of data subjects concerned. In addition, the Guidance outlines that if personal data is or will be disclosed in connection with a processing activity, the list must also contain information about which categories of personal data are or will be disclosed to the recipient in question.

 The Italian data protection authority ('Garante') issued, on 10 August 2020, a statement, on the use of contact tracing apps by public authorities and private companies during COVID-19 ('Coronavirus'). In particular, Garante highlighted that Coronavirus does not in itself constitute a sufficient legal basis for the processing of personal data. In addition, Garante emphasised that only processing which has its legal basis in a provision of national law is legitimate, whereas any other processing aimed at contact tracing is not an adequate legal basis, and is therefore, carried out in violation of European and national legislation on the protection of personal data. 
 The Telecommunications Regulatory Authority ('TRA') published, on 10 August 2020, guidelines ('the Guidelines') for internet service providers aiming to provide them with guidelines and recommendations to achieve a coordinated transition from IPv4 to IPv6. In particular, the Guidelines note that all new IP based services, such as cloud computing and data centres, within the private and public sector, should be able to run IPv6 protocols with immediate effect, and that certain security measures must be implemented. More specifically, with regards to security, the Guidelines propose the use of network security equipment, including firewalls, of Internet Protocol Security ('IPSec') to authenticate and provide confidentiality to assets, as well as the implementation of a security assessment to identify vulnerabilities. 
 The University of Maryland Faculty Physicians, Inc. ('FPI') and the University of Maryland Medical Center ('UMMC') notified, on 24 July 2020, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services' Office for Civil Rights ('OCR'), of a data breach affecting 33,896 patients, which the OCR is now investigating.

In particular, the standards constitute the first deliverable of the DSA, the authority responsible for cross-government data standardisation which is led by the Government Digital Service, and include best practices for sharing comma-separated values ('CSV') files. Firstly, the standard on using metadata to describe data shared within government discusses using the Dublin Core schema when sharing tabular data, like CSV files and spreadsheets, between government departments. Secondly, the standard on using metadata to describe tabular data for publishing recommends using the schema.org standard on data set to describe the contents of a CSV file, spreadsheet or other file type containing data to be published. Thirdly, the standard on using metadata to describe CSV data offers guidance using the CSV on the Web standard to add metadata to describe the contents and structure of CSV data files.  In addition, the guidance on record information about data sets to be shared with others addresses using metadata to facilitate the cataloguing, validation, reuse and sharing of data. Lastly, the guidance on publishing tabular data covers adding metadata to data being published so that search engines can find the data and display structured results for users. 
 The Information Commissioner's Office ('ICO') published, on 3 August 2020, a monetary penalty notice in which it fined Rain Trading Ld £80,000 under the Data Protection Act 1998 for making, between 1 January 2018 and 29 November 2018, 270,774 unsolicited direct marketing calls to subscribers registered with Telephone Preference Service Ltd ('TPS') without valid consent, in violation of regulation 21 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 ('PECR'). In particular, the ICO outlined that it had sent, on 8 January 2019, an initial investigation letter to RTL, to which it responded, among other things, that it had purchased the data for direct marketing purposes under contract from two third party data providers, that consent was not recorded, and that any due diligence checks were thought to have been carried out by the third party data providers. Furthermore, the ICO noted that RTL had intended to implement measures including options for recording consent, staff training and software to allow TPS-screening.  In assessing the contraventions, the ICO highlighted that it did not consider that RTL deliberately set out to contravene the PECR, however that it should have been aware of its responsibilities regarding due diligence and taking reasonable steps to prevent such violations. In calculating the monetary penalty, the ICO consider factors such as RTL ceasing its live marketing calls, complaints received to the ICO and the TPS as well as the lack of any internal suppression list to stop repeated calls to the same subscribers. As a result, the ICO issued a monetary penalty notice of £80,000 to be paid by 3 September 2020 at the latest and which can be reduced by 20% to £64,000 if paid by 2 September 2020 to promote compliance with the PECR. 
 OneTrust DataGuidance confirmed, on 10 August 2020, with the Information Commissioner's Office ('ICO'), that it is investigating Barclays regarding its employee monitoring tools. In particular, an ICO spokesperson said, "We have an ongoing investigation relating to Barclays' alleged use of employee monitoring tools."  More specifically, the spokesperson outlined, "People expect that they can keep their personal lives private and that they are also entitled to a degree of privacy in the workplace [...] If organisations wish to monitor their employees, they should be clear about its purpose and that it brings real benefits. Organisations also need to make employees aware of the nature, extent and reasons for any monitoring."
 The European Commission ('the Commission') and the U.S. Department of Commerce ('DoC') issued, on 10 August 2020, a joint statement announcing that they had initiated discussions to evaluate the potential for an enhanced EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework to comply with the Court Justice of the European Union's ('CJEU') judgment in Data Protection Commissioner v. Facebook Ireland Limited, Maximillian Schrems (C-311/18) ('the Schrems II Case').

In addition, the Commission and the DoC noted their shared commitment to privacy and the rule of law, as well as to further deepening their economic relationship. 
 The Norwegian data protection authority ('Datatilsynet') announced, on 10 August 2020, that it had issued an order ('the Order') to the International Baccalaureate Organization ('IBO') in relation to the grading of students based on historical data about former students. In particular, Datatilsynet highlighted that the IB grades were not correct because they did not reflect individual academic ability, thereby leading to discrimination, and that the processing was not in line with the reasonable expectations of data subjects, thus contradicting the fairness principle of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In addition, Datatilsynet noted that the processing taking place through this grading system may lead to denial of opportunities for students and that, in this case, it has adversely affected students in an undue and unjustifiable manner. On this basis, Datatilsynet gave the IBO the opportunity to submit its comments to the Order by 14 August 2020 and stated that, following these comments, a final decision will be taken. 
 The British Dental Association ('BDA') suffered, on 30 July 2020, a data breach, as a result of a sophisticated cyberattack.

In addition, the BDA noted that, at present, it is unsure what information has been compromised, although current evidence suggests that the data extracted relates to a very small snapshot of the total data stored on its servers. Moreover, the BDA stated that the Information Commissioner's Office ('ICO') has been informed of the breach, and outlined steps that members of the BDA can take as a precaution, including updating passwords regularly and remaining vigilant to changes in their bank account, although investigations have revealed that redirecting bank transfers and standing orders was not the objective of this attack. 
 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ('OCC') announced, on 6 August 2020, that it had issued an $80 million civil penalty against Capital One, N.A., and Capital One Bank (USA), N.A. In particular, the OCC highlighted that the fine relates to Capital One's failure to implement effective risk assessment processes before migrating significant information technology operations to a public cloud environment as well as not correcting the deficiencies in a timely manner. In addition, the OCC outlined that the deficiencies identified were not compliant with 12 C.F.R. Part 30, Appendix B, 'Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security Standards' and that sound risk management and internal controls procedures are essential for banks to adequately protect consumers and for the safety of bank operation.   UPDATE (11 August 2020)  FRB issues cease and desist order against Capital One  The Federal Reserve Board ('FRB') issued, on 6 August 2020, a cease and desist order against Capital One ('the Order').

 The Federal Communications Commission ('FCC') announced, on 5 August 2020, that FCC Commissioner, Geoffrey Starks, had send letters to AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications inquiring into their practices of aggregation and monetisation of sensitive consumer data. In particular, the FCC highlighted that consumer data is being aggregated and monetised for advertisement placement purposes, and that this data is being used to track consumers' locations to protests and places of worship. In this respect, the FCC noted that Starks is seeking information into AT&T and Verizon's participation in real-time bidding exchanges for mobile advertising, and is requesting details on each provider's policies and procedures to prohibit or minimise tracking of consumers. Specifically the FCC outlined that the letters sent to the service providers ask, among other things, the companies to explain their participation in monetising or using customer data intended for advertising placement to advance non-advertising objectives, to quantify the amount of US location data distributed in real-time bidding processes, and to detail policies in place to minimise, destroy, or prohibit the tracking of consumers according to their data.  The FCC noted that this follows a bipartisan group of members of the U.S. Congress sending a letter on the same to the Federal Trade Commission ('FTC'), requesting an investigation into such practices. 
 The French data protection authority ('CNIL') published, on 7 August 2020, its updated standard ('the Standard') which simplifies the conditions for accessing data from the permanent representative sample of the population ('EGB') protected by French health insurance within the National Inter-Regime Health Insurance Information System ('SNIIRAM'), following the entry into force of Law No. 2019-774 of 24 July 2019 on the Organisation and Transformation of the Health System. In particular, the update of the Standard aims to allow the Health Data Hub, under certain conditions, to access the relevant personal data in the context of processing activities which present a low risk for impact on the right to privacy. Specifically, the Standard specifies that access conditions include processing activities carried out for the purposes of research, study or analysis in the health sector, which serve the public interest, and for which access to the EGB, SNIIRAM or the related datamarts is necessary. In addition, the Standard highlights that, for such specific purposes of processing, neither the opinion of the Committee for Research, Study and Analysis in the health sector ('CESREES') nor authorisation from CNIL will need to be obtained.  Furthermore, the Standard has been updated with, among other things, a list of purposes for processing which can benefit from the new and simplified procedure, which includes changes in care, comparative analysis of treatment, description and analysis of patient pathologies and treatment plans. Moreover, the Standard adds that manufacturers and insurance providers working in the health sector can also benefit from the simplified access procedure, although they are required to collaborate with laboratories. Lastly, the Standard details that, where necessary, the period for which data can be accessed may be extended once for a maximum period of 24 months. 
 The European Consumer Organisation ('BEUC') issued, on 5 August 2020, a report ('the Report') on the two year anniversary of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') focusing on the enforcement of the GDPR from the perspective of consumers and national consumer organisations. In particular, the Report seeks to show the current lack of effectiveness in the application of the GDPR for consumer protection as a result of the lack of harmonised binding administrative procedures to deal with cross border complaints as well as the slow pace of proceedings. In addition, the Report makes recommendations, including the establishment of, among others, a common administrative procedure to handle complaints related to cross-border cases by the European Data Protection Board ('EDPB'), specific support mechanisms for data subjects or organisations representing them, and a list of organisations which would be considered eligible to represent data subjects under Article 80 of the GDPR. 
 The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission ('CBIRC') issued, on 5 August 2020, a fine of CNY 1 million (approx. €121,900) on China Merchants Bank Co., Ltd ('CMB') for failures to provide protection to personal data of customers and for reckless investigations into applicants' credit information.

In addition, the Blogpost highlights that quantum-safe cryptography which will not be affected by quantum computers, is not yet standardised and that, currently, until the transition to quantum-safe cryptography, organisations should consider for how long they need to ensure absolute confidentiality of data and protection from retrospective decryption. 
 The Chilean Transparency Council ('CPLT') issued, on 6 August 2020, a statement following the Undersecretariat of Telecommunications' ('SUBTEL') request that companies in the telecommunications sector disclose large amounts of personal data of users to SUBTEL. In particular, the CPLT noted that SUBTEL had sent a letter to companies requesting the delivery of customer data in order to carry out an opinion study, and secondly, that a company, after being awarded a tender for a technical standard for the provision of internet access and a minimum speed of internet, will be responsible for collecting user information through software that the company can install on cell phones or computers to measure speed, and which will collect and deliver individuals' data to SUBTEL.  In this respect, the CPLT outlined that the principles of necessity and proportionality must be respected, and only the necessary data for the intended purposes should be collected and used for those purposes only, in accordance with Law No. 19.628 on the Protection of Private Life 1999 ('the Law'). Moreover, the CPLT further urged compliance with international standards and norms on the same, and highlighted the new legal initiative under discussion in Parliament, which would modernise the Law and resolve gaps in the current legal framework. 
 The Hamburg Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information ('HmbBfDI') issued, on 4 August 2020, a statement ('the Statement') calling for federal legislators to limit law enforcement access to data collected for contact tracing for COVID-19 ('Coronavirus') purposes. In particular, the HmbBfDI noted that local data protection authorities are generally not able to monitor cases in which the massive amounts of data that is stored in reserve is used as an aid in the fulfillment of the tasks of the law enforcement authorities, as there is often a lack of knowledge about the cases of change of purpose. Furthermore, the HmbBfDI outlined that the possibility that law enforcement authorities use this data for their own purposes is largely unrestricted by the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Federal Data Protection Act of 30 June 2017 (implementing the GDPR) and that corresponding data processing, insofar as it is carried out to determine or punish criminal offences or administrative offences, must comply with the principle of proportionality. 
 The Dutch data protection authority ('AP') published, on 6 August 2020, initial results (' the Results') on its investigation into smart cities.

Specifically, the AP highlighted that, among other things, municipalities should clearly indicate what data is being processed, review and update DPIAs, and allow 14 weeks for possible prior consultation.  Furthermore, the AP stated that it expects to complete the investigation after the summer, later than expected due to the COVID-19 ('Coronavirus') pandemic. 
 The Office of the Commissioner for Personal Data Protection ('the Commissioner') issued, on 5 August 2020, a statement, answering questions relating to measures taken by organisations to prevent the spread of COVID-19 ('Coronavirus'). In particular, the Commissioner referred to its previous statement on the use of thermal cameras and highlighted such use is only allowed if there is a legal basis pursuant to the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), and provided that the principles of purpose limitation and data minimisation are fulfilled. Furthermore, in relation to employers conducting diagnostic tests, the Commissioner emphasised that in the absence of decrees by the Ministry of Health which determine the circumstances under which such tests can be carried out, the employer cannot oblige employees to give their consent for this purpose, as consent in the context of employment does not constitute a free expression of will. 
 The State Data Protection Inspectorate ('VDAI') announced, on 4 August 2020, that it had launched a public consultation for the description ('the Description') of the procedure for submitting requests of data controllers for approval of Binding Corporate Rules ('BCR').

Facebook Ireland Limited, Maximillian Schrems (C-311/18) ('the Schrems II Case'). In particular, the OPCNZ highlighted that the decision in the Schrems II Case does not directly affect personal data transfers between the EU and New Zealand because these transfers are conducted on the basis of the existing adequacy decision which has been in place since 2012. However, the OPCNZ noted that the influence of the decision on international data transfers is likely to be significant and will have an impact on the international framework for data flows. In addition, the OPCNZ outlined that it will take the decision in the Schrems II Case into consideration when developing model contract clauses under the Privacy Act 2020, which includes new limits on international transfers of personal information under information privacy principle 12. 
 U.S. Congresswoman, Anna Eshoo, sent, on 5 August 2020, along with other Members of Congress and California State legislators, a letter ('the Letter') to the California Department of Motor Vehicles ('DMV') inquiring into its data privacy and security practices.

 The Polish data protection authority ('UODO') published, on 4 August, its decision ('the Decision') to issue a reprimand to a secondary school for processing students' personal data in connection with a questionnaire conducted to identify students who require psychological support from the school they attend. In particular, the UODO highlighted that the processing was contrary to Article 6(1)(c) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), as the legal acts regulating the principles of the functioning of educational institutions do not specify such tasks and obligations. However, the UODO noted that a reprimand was sufficient at this stage, as the school took immediate corrective actions such as destroying the questionnaire forms and organising employee training to raise awareness of the protection of personal data. 
 The Danish data protection authority ('Datatilsynet') issued, on 5 August 2020, its decision ('the Decision') stating that it is permissible under the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') for an unnamed company to process fingerprint information for the purpose of uniquely identifying employees, following consultation with the Data Council. In particular, the Datatilsynet highlighted that a trade union had complained on behalf of one of its members that a company processes information about fingerprints with a view to unambiguously identifying which employee is approaching and leaving the workplace. Furthermore, the Decision outlines that one of the council members did not believe that the Datatilsynet was competent to deal with the issue, as the matter is covered by the Danish Employers' Confederation and the Danish Trade Union Confederation ('the DA/LO Agreement') on control measures, so the member believed that the trade union system was the right forum.  In the Decision, the Datatilsynet highlighted that the company stated that this was a control measure which had been notified in accordance with the main agreement between the DA/LO Agreement. Furthermore, the Datatilsynet noted that the company justified the control measure on the grounds that it is crucial for food safety, including the company's export opportunities, that unauthorised persons do not gain access to the production site and that it can be identified at any time who has participated in the production of a given product. Moreover, the Datatilsynet outlined in the Decision that key tags that employees scan do not provide sufficient assurance that it can be unambiguously identified who has been present in the production, as there may be theft of key tags or replacement of key tags, both incorrectly and intentionally. In addition, the Datatilsynet emphasised that the system does not store images of the individual's fingerprint, but a unique template based on the fingerprint. Specifically, the scanner is designed so that data in the scanner, should it fall into the wrong hands, could not be used without a copy of the associated database, and that the database is located on a server at the group's head office that only the IT department's employees have access to via a separate coding system. Furthermore, the Datatilsynet noted that non-employees do not have access to the company's PCs, and that the information in the system can only be accessed by the few employees who have a work-related need for this, which only includes the IT department and the group's payroll office.  After an overall review, the Datatilsynet found that there was no basis for overriding the company's assessment as the processing could therefore take place in accordance with Article 5 of the GDPR and Section 12(1) of Act No. 502 of 23 May 2018 on Supplementary Provisions to the Regulation on the Protection of Natural Persons with Regard to the Processing of Personal Data and on the Free Movement of Such Data.

In particular, the SADEA aims to enable trusted cross-border data flows while avoiding requirements such as data localisation, but still protecting consumers' privacy and businesses' proprietary information.  Furthermore, Sing stated that, 'the SADEA will facilitate digitalisation of trade processes and make it easier and more cost-effective for Singapore companies to engage in cross border business activities with Australia. As COVID-19 ('Coronavirus') forces businesses to consider innovative ways to reach customers and adapt to a new way of doing business, agreements like the SADEA will allow our companies to take advantage of opportunities in the digital economy and tap on new technologies to create new digital products and services.' 
 The Spanish data protection authority ('AEPD') published, on 4 August 2020, a decision ('the Decision') in proceedings PS/00009/2020, fining Vodafone España, SAU €60,000 for violating Article 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In particular, the AEPD noted that the claimant alleged that they had received a message from Vodafone España thanking them for a purchase that they did not recognise and that was made in a store of which they were a customer. Futhermore, the purchase was made using the claimants personal and banking details to obtain prepaid Lycamobile cards. Moreover, as Vodafone España agreed to a voluntary payment, the fine was reduced to €48,000. 
 The European Commission ('the Commission') announced, on 4 August 2020, that it has launched an in-depth investigation into Google LLC's proposed acquisition of Fitbit Inc. In particular, the Commission highlighted its concern that the proposed transaction will further strengthen Google's market position in the online advertising markets by increasing the amount of data that Google could use for personalisation of the ads it displays. In light of this, the Commission noted that the data advantage afforded to Google through this transaction would increase the barriers to entry and expansion for Google's competitors in the online advertising market. In addition, the Commission stated that it has 90 days until 9 December 2020 to make a decision. 
 The Institute of Transparency and Access to Information ('INAI') announced, on 25 July 2020, its participation in the creation of the Working Group Intersecretary on Digital Commerce ('the Group'), convened by the Ministry of Economy.

 The Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman ('the Ombudsman') announced, on 05 August 2020, that the Sanctions Chamber of the Ombudsman ('the Sanctions Chamber'), had issued a decision ('the Decision') in which it had fined Independent Consulting Oy (Acc Consulting Varsinais-Suomi) €7,000 for sending electronic direct marketing messages without prior consent and for non-compliance with the data subject rights. In particular, the Decision relates to 11 complaints received by the Ombudsman relating to the company's direct electronic marketing and non-exercise of data subject rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In addition, the Sanctions Chamber held that the company could not rely on the defence that it had conducted targeted electronic direct marketing to entities which do not require consent under the Act on Electronic Communications Services (917/2014), as the company had not conducted any assessments prior to the marketing considering, among other things, the recipient's job.  Moreover, the Decision notes that some of the complaints concerned the fact that data subjects had made requests to the controller for their rights under the GDPR and that the controller had not responded to the requests as required without undue delay and within a maximum of one month of receipt of the request. In addition, the Decision highlights that the controller did not appear to have organised its procedures for processing personal data in such a way that it can indicate whether it had exercised the data subjects' rights or received requests for rights and that therefore was unable to demonstrate that it had processed personal data lawfully.  Lastly, the Decision outlines that the Deputy Ombudsman of the Office also obliges the controller to rectify its conduct with regard to direct marketing and has ordered the company to change its practices and exercise the data subject's rights in accordance with the GDPR. 
 The Department of Internal Affairs ('DIA') announced, on 5 August 2020, the development of a Digital Identity Trust Framework ('the Framework') in legislation.

Furthermore, the DIA noted that the legislation will enable providers to be accredited against the Framework rules, which will be based on existing and developing standards and will support the development of security, privacy-enhancing, and interoperable approaches to digital identity services.  The legislation is scheduled to be introduced in 2021. 
 The French data protection authority ('CNIL') announced, on 5 August 2020, its decision ('the Decision') issued on 28 July 2020 to impose a €250,000 fine on Spartoo SAS for violating multiple provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In particular, the Decision outlines that Spartoo breached the principle of data minimisation under Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR, retained the data for longer than was necessary under Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR, as well as failed to abide by the obligation to inform under Article 13 of the GDPR, and to take adequate measures to ensure the security of data as required by Article 32 of the GDPR. More specifically, in light of the purposes of processing data for employee training and fraud prevention, CNIL considered that the permanent recording of telephone calls with customer service employees, the recording of customer bank details, and the collection of customers' health cards were excessive and, thus, contrary to data minimisation.  In addition, CNIL found that the Spartoo had not set up a retention period for customer and prospect data, and also did not regularly erase and archive personal data. Moreover, CNIL held that retaining, for a period exceeding five years, names and passwords in a non-anonymised form to enable customers to re-use their account contradicted Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR. Moreover, CNIL held that customers were misinformed about the legal bases for the data processing and that employees had not been adequately informed about the purpose behind the processing, the recipients of the data, the data retention period, and their rights, which meant that Spartoo breached its obligation to provide information under Article 13 of the GPDR. Lastly, CNIL noted that Spartoo had not used adequately strong passwords for accessing customer accounts and, thus, failed to ensure the security of data processed by the company as required by Article 32 of the GDPR.  Therefore, CNIL, also taking into account the three million clients and 25 million prospects affected, as well as the retention of bank data, imposed a €250,000 fine on Spartoo and asked that it brings its processing in conformity with the GDPR within three months of the notification of the Decision.

 The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada ('OPC') issued, on 4 August 2020, its report of findings ('the Findings') following its investigation into a complaint of TD Canada Trusts' decision to outsource the processing of fraud claims to a third-party service provider. In particular, the Findings note that the complaint highlighted TD's decision to outsource aspects of its fraud claims processing services to a third-party service provider in India and that TD did not obtain consent for, or allow customers to opt-out of, the transfer of personal information to a service provider in a foreign jurisdiction.  In this respect, the Findings outline that the third-party service provider was using TD customers' information to manage fraud claims for TD and that TD was not required to obtain separate consent for or to provide customers the choice to opt-out of, the transfer of personal information to the third-party service provider for that same purpose. In addition, the Findings highlight that TD was sufficiently open about this transfer, provided customers with information pertaining to its transfers, and also made this information available through its privacy resources, as well as had been accountable with respect to the information it transferred and ensured a comparable level of protection for that information. As such, the Findings conclude that the complaint was not well-founded and that TD had met its requirements under Canada's federal private sector privacy legislation.

In particular, the Letter outlines the view that the FTC does not function as an effective privacy agency and that the U.S. Congress should establish an independent data protection agency, with the Senate Commerce Committee instead scheduling a hearing on Senate Bill 3300 to establish a Federal data protection agency. Specifically, the Letter notes three key points for the Senate Commerce Committee's consideration in this respect, highlighting the FTC's failure to stop mergers that threaten consumer privacy, the FTC's failure to establish data protection standards as it cannot enforce its own consent orders, and the general need for a US data protection agency because of the lacking authority and expertise of the FTC.

 The Danish data protection authority ('Datatilsynet') announced, on 4 August 2020, that it had fined PrivatBo AmbA DKK 150,000 (approx. €20,100) and reported it to the police after it had transferred tenants' confidential information and therefore not implemented appropriate technical and organisational security measures in violation of Article 32 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In particular, the Datatilsynet noted that PrivatBo, a management company, assisted a housing fund with the intended sale of three properties, and that PrivatBo had provided material for the properties in question, which was distributed to the occupants of the properties in a total of 424 USB keys. However, PrivatBo was not aware that for some of the leases handed out, documents were attached which contained personal data of a confidential nature and which should not have been disclosed. Therefore, the Datatilsynet chose to report PrivatBo to the police for the unintentional transfer of personal information that took place as part of the handing over of the 424 USB keys.  In addition, the Datatilsynet found grounds for expressing serious criticism that PrivatBo subsequently, in connection with the same offer obligation, unintentionally distributed information relating to outstanding deposits and prepaid rent, and in some cases information on disbursements in deposits, to residents in a property other than that which was subject to the obligation in question. The unintentional disclosure of this information occurred despite the fact that PrivatBo had hired an external auditing company. 
 The Information and Privacy Agency ('AIP') issued, on 15 July 2020, a statement on the processing of personal data during the COVID-19 ('Coronavirus') pandemic, with an emphasis on health institutions as data controllers.

 The None of your business–European Center for Digital Rights ('NOYB') announced, on 4 August 2020, that it had issued a complaint ('the Complaint') with the Austrian data protection authority ('DSB') against the credit rating agency CRIF GmbH, which is active in 28 states, for violating the right to information, data correctness, and transparency in a proceeding regarding the negative rating of an applicant for an electricity contract. In particular, NOYB held that the application for an electricity contract had been rejected by the energy provider based on an insufficient credit check based on an assessment conducted by CRIF. Furthermore, NOYB held that the rejected applicant had received a yellow rating and a scoring of 446 points by CRIF and that when asked to provide access to the applicant's information stored, CRIF responded that they no longer had any data on him. Moreover, CRIF held that it had not conducted a credit rating on the applicant and that the rejection of the energy contract was based on a decision taken by the energy provider.  Furthermore, NOYB held that the applicant found that CRIF had violated his right to information under Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') because CRIF only provided incomplete data, contrary to the principle of data correctness under Article 5(1)(d) of the GDPR, as CRIF transferred (potentially invented) incorrect data to the energy provider. In addition, NOYB highlighted that CRIF had violated the principle of transparency under Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR.  Finally, NOYB announced that the Complaint is the first step in its mission to examine credit rating agencies in Europe over the next months and years and to conduct proceedings under the GDPR in relevant cases.

Therefore, the UODO noted that when state organisations perform their tasks on the basis of their statutory powers, they cannot be refused access to the requested documents.  However, the UODO highlighted that such organisations must comply with the GDPR principles of proportionality, purpose limitation, and data minimisation. 
 U.S. Senator, Ron Wyden, announced, on 31 July 2020, that he had sent, along with other U.S. Senators and Members of Congress, a letter ('the Letter') to the Federal Trade Commission ('FTC') urging it to investigate the practices of companies in the adtech industry. In particular, the Letter calls for the investigation of the adtech industry's selling of personal information through real-time bidding ('RTB'), in which personal information is collected without individuals' consent, including device identifiers and cookies or location data and IP addresses, and auctioned in order for individuals to then receive targeted advertising. In addition, the Letter notes that there is no effective way to control RTB infrastructure, individuals have not consented to be tracked and their information to be collected, and often technological roadblocks such as browser privacy settings or ad blockers are insufficient and circumvented by adtech companies. As such, the Letter urges the FTC to investigate the adtech industry practices and data brokers associated with such companies.

 The Personal Data Protection Commission ('PDPC') announced, on 3 August 2020, that it had fined the Management Development Institute of Singapore ('MDIS') Corporation Pte Ltd SGD 10,000 (approx. €6,190) for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data of individuals who had provided their information to MDIS Corporation for registration purposes. In particular, the PDPC highlighted that MDIS Corporation had breached Section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No. 26 of 2012) ('PDPA') by failing to communicate any data protection requirements to its vendor or developer and to detect vulnerabilities prior to the launch of the website. Furthermore, the PDPC noted that while an organisation may delegate work to vendors in order to comply with the PDPA, an organisation's responsibility to comply with its obligations under the PDPA may not be delegated.

In particular, the PDPC noted that the unauthorised disclosure arose from a logical error which FWD Singapore should have taken care to avoid by conducting its manual code review and unit testing. Moreover, the PDPC highlighted that it had not issued any direction to FWD Singapore as they have implemented steps to improve their development processes to prevent the recurrence of such an incident. 
 The Personal Data Protection Commission ('PDPC') announced, on 3 August 2020, that it had fined the Central Depository (Pte) Limited SGD 32,000 (approx. €19,821) for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of individuals' personal data in breach of Section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No. 26 of 2012). In particular, the PDPC highlighted that dividend cheques of some account holders had been mailed to outdated addresses, resulting in the unauthorised disclosure of personal data. Furthermore, the PDPC found that the Central Depository had failed to conduct sufficient testing before migrating from one mailing system to another resulting, in a risk of fraud and financial loss. 
 The Personal Data Protection Commission ('PDPC') announced, on 3 August 2020, that it had issued a warning ('the Warning') to Actstitude Pte Ltd for failure to put in place reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised disclosure of 160 individuals' personal data in breach of Section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No. 26 of 2012). In particular, the Warning notes that Actstitude did not conduct wulnerability scanning as part of pre-lauchin testing of their website, and did not conduct periodic security reviews. Moreover, the Warning notes that the failure to put it place access controls or to conduct security testing resulted in, among other things, Google's website indexing and disclosing the resumes for search containing the names of the individuals, which led to a complaing to the PDPC on 25 October 2019. 
 The Personal Data Protection Commission ('PDPC') announced, on 3 August 2020, that it had issued a warning to Jean Yip Salon Pte Ltd for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of personal data of 28 of its employees in breach of Section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No. 26 of 2012). In particular, the PDPC highlighted that Jean Yip Salon had opened public access to a server without ascertaining what it hosted, and therefore had inadvertently allowed access to the internal system. Furthermore, the PDPC found that there were no processes in place to remove or deactivate unnecessary user accounts and that Jean Yip Salon did not enforce a password policy for user accounts. 
 The Personal Data Protection Commission ('PDPC') issued, on 3 August 2020, a warning to Zero1 Pte Ltd and IP Tribe Pte Ltd for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of 118 individuals' personal data contained in invoices which were sent to incorrect recipients in breach of Section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No. 26 of 2012). In particular, the PDPC noted that information including name, address, subscriber ID, and mobile numbers were disclosed. Finally, the PDPC highlighted that it had not issued any direction to Zero1 and IP Tribe as they have taken remedial actions to address the gaps in their security arrangements. 
 The Personal Data Protection Commission ('PDPC') announced, on 3 August 2020, that it had fined the Singapore Accountancy Commission SGD 5,000 (approx. €3,097) for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised access of 6,541 personnel and candidates' personal data in breach of Section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No. 26 of 2012). In particular, the PDPC noted that information including names, National Registration Identification Card numbers, dates of birth, contact details, education, and employment information, as well as exam results had been sent to 41 unintended recipients between 12 June 2019 and 22 October 2019. 
 The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of New Zealand ('OPCNZ') released, on 3 August 2020, a blog post addressing the definition of personal information under the Privacy Act 1993 ('the Act') in light of recent decisions considered by the Human Rights Review Tribunal and the High Court of New Zealand. In particular, the OPCNZ highlighted that in Taylor v Chief Executive of the Department of Corrections ([2018] NZHRRT 35, the High Court noted that Mr Taylor's personal information appeared on the same pages as the names of Corrections Officers which did not constitute personal information, and therefore did not need to be disclosed under the Act because it was essentially administrative information. Furthermore, the High Court clarified that the information regarding the Corrections Officers did not automatically become Mr Taylor's information, it appeared on the same page as his personal information because it was still possible to distinguish and redact their names from the personal information about Mr Taylor without making the substantive content of the documents unintelligible. As such, the OPCNZ highlighted that when deciding whether third party information can be treated as 'mixed information,' an agency should consider whether the information is 'essentially administrative' and if the redactions of information would render the communications unintelligible. In addition, the OPCNZ confirmed that if an agency determines that the names or details of another individual are not the personal information of the requester, then the agency should not assess or withhold this information under the Act. 
 The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People's Republic of China ('MIIT') announced, on July 31, 2020, its plan for its special rectification action of apps infringing user rights and interests. In particular, the MIIT noted enterprises should carry out self-examination and correction, focusing on apps and software developer kits ('SDK') that process users' personal information in violation of applicable regulations, among other things. In addition, the MIIT noted that, along with provincial communications administrations, it will strengthen the supervision and inspection of apps and SDKs, and will increase the handling and exposure of violations in accordance with applicable legislation. Moreover, the MIIT emphasised that if incomplete rectification continues, measures such as public announcements, organisation removals, disconnection, and administrative penalties will be adopted. 
 The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People's Republic of China ('MIIT') issued, on 3 August 2020, a notice on its pilot demonstration of cybersecurity technology application in 2020 ('the Notice').

In addition, the Report details other achievements such as the completion of an investigation of the first disclosure of improper conduct under the Whistleblower Protection Law (2015). 
 The Australian Communications and Media Authority ('ACMA') published, on 30 July 2020, two reports, one on artificial intelligence ('the AI Report') and another on the Internet of Things ('the IoT Report') in media and communications. In particular, the AI Report highlights regulatory responses to AI, provides an overview of the AI ethics principles created under the AI Ethics Framework, as well as outlines the challenges facing communications and media markets. In addition, the IoT Report covers network infrastructure, spectrum management, equipment standards, and consumer safeguards, as well as outlines the ACMA's IoT activities. 
 The Office of the Data Protection Authority ('ODPA') published, on 30 July 2020, its 2019 annual report ('the Report'). In particular, the Report reiterates the importance placed by the ODPA on preventing harm rather than punishing it, an approach which was highlighted in its 2019-2022 strategic plan. In addition, the Report outlines the progress made towards the ODPA's strategic objectives of delivering its enhanced statutory duties and elevating discussions around the protection of personal data, among others, which include steps, such as playing a vital role in the Bailiwick's ongoing adequacy review by the European Commission, and regularly publishing comments and thought pieces on data related matters. Furthermore, the Report details three anonymous case studies of personal data infringements and their learning outcomes, and highlights key statistics for the period from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019, including the fact that 67 complaints were received, and 50 investigations were conducted by the ODPA. 
 The Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of British Columbia ('OIPC') issued, on 31 July 2020, guidance ('the Guidance') on the collection of personal information at restaurants, bars, gatherings, and events, following the Public Health Officer's ('PHO') two orders on the same for food service establishments, liquor services, and events ('the Food Service Order') as well as for gatherings and events ('the Events Order'). In particular, the Food Service Order requires establishments, if already collecting information from individuals in order to make reservations, to retain contact information for one member of every party for 30 days, while venues hosting an event must retain contact information for every individual for 30 days. In addition, the Events Order requires organisers of events to retain contact information for every individual for 30 days, and if the event takes place at a vacation accommodation, the owner of the rental must retain the contact information provided to the organiser for 30 days.  In this respect, the Guidance assists those subject to these orders with compliance that also meets the requirements to protect individuals' privacy under the Personal Information Protection Act, SBC 2003 c 63 ('PIPA'). Specifically, the Guidance highlights the need to inform individuals of data collection practices, ensure collection of only minimum and necessary information, and ensure effective record keeping, record retention, and data security practices. 
 The National Institute of Standards and Technology ('NIST') released, on 31 July 2020, the Draft NIST Special Publication ('SP') 800-53B, on control baselines for information systems and organisations, for public comment. In particular, NIST highlighted that SP 800-53B seeks to provide security control baselines for low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact federal systems, as well as privacy control baselines for all systems irrespective of impact level. In addition, NIST outlined that SP 800-53B provides guidance on the control section process for organisations and the development of overlays to facilitate the customisation of control baselines for specific communities of interest, technologies, and environments of operation.  Comments on SP 800-53B can be submitted to [email protected] by 11 September 2020. 
 The Interactive Advertising Bureau ('IAB') Europe published, on 31 July 2020, a blogpost ('the Blogpost') by IAB's Privacy and Compliance Manager, Ninon Vagner, outlining best practices for publishers to help implement the Transparency and Consent Framework 2.0 ('TCF 2.0') by 15 August 2020. In particular, the Blogpost highlights that TCF 2.0 is designed to standardise the collection and transmission of user choice and transparency to ensure alignment of the digital advertising supply chain can with the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') and Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications (Directive 2002/58/EC) ('the ePrivacy Directive') requirements. More specifically, the Blogpost outlines that, among other things, publishers will need to publicly show compliance with TCF policies and specification, for instance in their privacy policy, to use a consent management provider ('CMP') which offers interfaces for users to set their preferences for purposes and vendors, as well as to establish specific legal bases for the data processing. In addition, the Blogpost notes that for third-party data processors publishers are advised to ask them to verify their signals prior to storing and/or accessing the information on users' devices or processing personal data. 
 The Russian State Parliament ('Duma') announced, on 3 August 2020, that amendments were made to the Federal Law 'On the National Payment System' and the Federal Law 'On the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (Bank of Russia)' ('the Amendments'). In particular, Duma noted that, from 3 August 2020, individuals will not be able to replenish electronic wallets without prior identification. In addition, under the Amendments, identification requirements will apply to all payments made using electronic money, including transports cards, as well as services for paying school meals. Moreover, Duma noted that the Amendments are necessary to restrict suspicious transactions used, among other things, for illegal financial transactions including those aimed at financing terrorism or drug trafficking. 
 The Polish data protection authority ('UODO') issued, on 31 July 2020, a statement noting the employer's right to display the best performance of employees, while ensuring that the principles of data minimisation and purpose limitation under the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') are complied with. In addition, the UODO highlighted, among other things, that such processing can be justified by the employer's legitimate interest as a data controller to ensure an effective functioning of the workplace, who must further demonstrate that his/her interests override those of the data subject's, pursuant to Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR. Furthermore, the UODO stated that employers should take measures to protect employees' rights and freedoms, such as ensuring that the results of employees' appraisals are not published in an accessible place. 
 Insurance Europe announced, on 3 August 2020, that it had published an insight briefing ('the Insight Briefing') about the European insurance industry's views on artificial intelligence ('AI'). Furthermore, Insurance Europe outlined three challenges in maximising the benefit for both consumers and themselves in their use of AI. Firstly, Insurance Europe noted that when developing AI systems, insurers face restricted access to data from the public sector, and stated that, for maximum societal benefit, such datasets should be available for free and in a machine-readable format. In addition, Insurance Europe highlighted that the non-personal data for some AI applications is also sometimes concentrated in the hands of a few entities, resulting in restricted or expensive access to data that could improve AI systems and better serve customers.  Insurance Europe further noted in the Insight Briefing that insurers would like to see a holistic approach to regulation. Moreover, Insurance Europe stated that the EU legal framework already covers areas relevant to AI such as fundamental rights, privacy, and data protection, as well as product safety and liability, which is then complemented by national regulatory frameworks. To support the development and uptake of AI, and to avoid unnecessary regulatory burdens, Insurance Europe noted that a horizontal, proportionate, and principles-based AI regulatory framework is needed that builds on existing EU and national regulatory frameworks. Insurance Europe also opined that there is currently a lack of effective collaboration between authorities with responsibilities in the field of digitalisation and that there is a need for all national authorities, whether they are responsible for the conduct of business, prudential regulation, competition, or data protection, to work closely together and ensure consistency in applying the rules to further develop the digital single market.  Furthermore, Insurance Europe stipulated that new EU rules for AI are only required if there are gaps in existing legislation, and for this reason, European (re)insurers do not support the creation of a civil liability regime for the use of AI because developing any kind of strict liability and compulsory insurance scheme for AI would not work. In addition, as Insurance Europe noted in the Insight Briefing, the conditions for mandatory insurance, which include sufficient similarity in the risks being covered and sufficient data on the risks, are not met. Moreover, Insurance Europe called for existing legislation to be reviewed to see if it creates barriers to AI, for example, further guidance on the application of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). Finally, Insurance Europe called for the deployment of ethical, trustworthy, and human-centric AI via an appropriate, risk-based, and proportionate regulatory framework. The scope of the framework should be targeted only at those AI applications with proven high risk and significant effects on the rights of individuals, as not all uses of AI pose significant risks or directly impact consumers. In the context of financial services legislation, and insurance, in particular, principles such as transparency, fairness, accountability, and ethics are to some extent already addressed by rules on the conduct of business and disclosure, while rules on advice apply whether the recommendation is provided by a human or by AI. 
 The National Institute of Standards and Technology ('NIST') published, on 31 July 2020, Special Publication (SP) 800-210, General Access Control Guidance for Cloud Systems ('the Guidance'). In particular, the Guidance presents an initial step toward understanding the security challenges in cloud systems by analysing the access control considerations in the three cloud service delivery models, namely Infrastructure as a Service ('IaaS'), Platform as a Service ('PaaS'), and Software as a Service ('SaaS'). Specifically, the Guidance summarises, among other things, essential characteristics that would affect the cloud's access control design, including broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, measured service, and data sharing, as well as proposes guidance and recommendations for access control design of IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS in order to facilitate future implementations for such systems. 
 The European Banking Authority ('EBA') launched, on 31 July 2020, a public consultation aimed at revising its guidelines on internal governance for credit institutions. In particular, the draft guidelines on internal governance under Directive (EU) 2013/36/EU on access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms ('the Draft Guidelines') highlight that internal governance includes all standards and principles concerned with setting credit institutions' objectives, strategies and risk management frameworks. Furthermore, the Draft Guidelines outline that combatting money laundering and terrorist financing is essential for maintaining stability and integrity in the financial system. In addition, the Draft Guidelines note that credit institutions should avoid setting up non-transparent structures and undertake a risk assessment to ensure that such structures are not connected with money laundering, terrorist financing or other financial crimes. Moreover, the Draft Guidelines include rules on internal alert procedures and whistleblowing, and state that such procedures must ensure the protection of the personal data of persons reporting the breach and persons allegedly responsible of the breach in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR').  The deadline for submission of comments is 31 October 2020. 
 The Australian Data and Digital Council ('ADDC') announced, on 31 July 2020, that it will develop a National Digital Identity Roadmap as part of its commitment to aligning with the Trusted Digital Identity Framework. In particular, the ADDC highlighted that taking a national approach would ensure consistency and interoperability across jurisdictions on digital identity verification, support the ability for commonly held digital identities to be re-used across jurisdictions, and enhance the experience for individuals and businesses interacting with government and across government boundaries. 
 The Spanish data protection authority ('AEPD') issued, on 31 July 2020, a statement ('the Statement') addressing the collection of personal data by entertainment venues in the context of the COVID-19 ('Coronavirus') pandemic. In particular, the AEPD held that although personal data is collected in order to trace the infection of Coronavirus, such data is not classified as sensitive personal data. Moreover, the AEPD highlighted that if consent is used as a legal basis for data processing, no negative consequences, such as the prevention of entry, could be imposed to persons that do not want to provide consent. In addition, the AEPD found that a mandatory obligation to provide personal data can be based on a legal obligation and Article 6(1)(e) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') as it would be justified by the public interest. Furthermore, the AEPD found that health authorities should assess in which public spaces it is necessary to impose a mandatory identification requirement, taking into account whether there could be more moderate measures and the specificities of the sphere, highlighting among other things, nightclubs and museums.  Finally, the AEPD held that the principle of data minismisation must be respected and that it can sometimes be sufficient to obtain a telephone number to trace an infection. The AEPD found that identification through a national identiy card is always unnecessary because it is considered to be disproportionate. 
 The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada ('OPC') issued, on 31 July 2020, a statement along with the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario ('IPC') following their review of the COVID Alert exposure notification application ('the App'), and issued a review and recommendations on the same. In particular, the OPC and IPC noted that they support the use of the App as it had now met all the privacy principles previously highlighted in a joint statement on COVID-19 ('Coronavirus') contact tracing apps, which included principles of consent and trust, necessity and proportionality, purpose limitation, de-identification, time limitation, transparency, accountability, and safeguards. Specifically, the OPC and IPC highlighted, among other things, that use of the App is voluntary and has been developed with robust safeguards to protect user identities, and although there is still a risk that third parties may seek to compel the disclosure of information on individuals' use of the App, the OPC and IPC have undertaken to communicate publicly that individuals should not be required to use the App or to disclose information about their use. 
 The Australian Cyber Security Centre ('ACSC') released, on 2 August 2020, guidance ('the Guidance') on mitigating ransomware threats for aged care and healthcare sectors following recent ransomware campaigns. In particular, the Guidance outlines a number of recommendations, including that organisations should report cyber incidents to the ACSC, identify and backup critical information and systems, undergo regular patching to keep systems and software up to date, as well as use antivirus software on all devices. 
 The U.S. Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration ('ITA') updated, on 31 July 2020, its frequently asked questions ('FAQs') in relation to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework ('the Privacy Shield'), following the Court of Justice of the European Union's judgment in Data Protection Commissioner v. Facebook Ireland Limited, Maximillian Schrems (C-311/18). In particular, the ITA noted that the judgment does not relieve participants in the Privacy Shield of their obligations under the framework and that the US remains committed to working with the EU to ensure continuity in transatlantic data flows and privacy protections. Furthermore, the ITA highlighted that the continued participation in the Privacy Shield demonstrates a serious commitment to protect personal information and that it continues to administer the program, including processing submissions for self-certification and re-certification to the Privacy Shield and maintaining the Privacy Shield List. 
 The Information Commissioner ('the Commissioner') published, on 30 July 2020, an infographic ('the Infographic') illustrating the rights and obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In particular, the Infographic provides information on data subject rights, records of processing activities, and requirements for the drafting of a controller-processor agreement, among other things. 
 The Information Technology Industry Council ('ITI') sent, on 30 July 2020, a joint industry letter ('the Letter') to European and US regulators urging them to negotiate a successor agreement to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield ('the Privacy Shield'), following its invalidation by the Court of Justice of the European Union's ('CJEU') judgment in Data Protection Commissioner v. Facebook Ireland Limited, Maximillian Schrems (C-311/18) ('the Schrems II Case'). In particular, the Letter welcomes the CJEU's upholding of Standard Contractual Clauses ('SCCs') as a valid transfer mechanism, and goes on to encourage the US and EU governments to work together to ensure that companies can fully and safely rely on data transfer mechanisms, as well as to ensure the long-term viability of SCCs in order to avoid legal uncertainty and economic harm. In addition, the Letter notes the importance of EU data protection authorities providing guidance to companies that were using Privacy Shield to transfer data in order to allow them to continue business operations until a successor agreement is reached. 
 The Information Commissioner ('the Commissioner') issued, on 30 July 2020, a statement reiterating the inadequate legal basis for the operation of the mobile application ('the App') for informing people about contact with those infected of COVID-19 ('Coronavirus'). In particular, the Commissioner highlighted that the Data Protection Impact Assessment ('DPIA') carried out in respect of the data processing through the App does not remedy the serious deficiencies in the law and the risks arising from the ambiguities as to whether there is a clear and constitutional legal basis for the processing of personal data related to the operation of the App. In addition, the Commissioner emphasised that such a high risk cannot be mitigated by organisational measures alone, and noted that the mere fact that the use of contact tracing applications is voluntary does not mean that the processing of personal data will be based on consent, as is the case of public authorities providing a service by delegation, where the most relevant legal basis for processing would be that processing is necessary for the performance of a task in the public interest, as provided under Article 6(1)(e) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). 
 The Danish data protection authority ('Datatilsynet') issued, on 31 July 2020, its decision ('the Decision') expressing serious criticism of the Region of Southern Denmark for failing to conduct the necessary risk assessment and testing during the development of an IT system, which led to the unauthorised access of pregnant women's names, social security numbers, and information regarding the pregnancy in violation of Articles 32(1), 33(5), and 34(2) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). Moreover, the Datatilsynet noted that the Region of Southern Denmark had reported a breach of personal data security, and that the Decision had been on the basis of a lack of risk assessment of processing, a lack of measures regarding development and testing, a lack of timely documentation of the circumstances of the breach, and deficiencies in the notification to data subjects.  In particular, the Datatilsynet highlighted that in the notification to the data subjects, the Region of Southern Denmark had only stated that names and social security numbers had been exposed, despite the fact that information on pregnancy could also be deduced from the exposed information and the context in which the information was included. Furthermore, the Datatilsynet noted that because the data controller must document data breaches, avoid similar breaches in the future, and possibly inform the affected data subjects, it is essential for GDPR compliance that the data controller has mechanisms that ensure knowledge of the incidents, and that it can recognise and document an understanding of the circumstances of the breach. 
 The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ('APEC') published, on 20 July 2020, a report ('the Report') on a standards and process-based approach to enhancing cybersecurity. In particular, the Report recommends the adoption of a five-function framework to guide and supplement the use of globally relevant cybersecurity standards and good practices. Furthermore, the Report reviews the different cybersecurity approaches adopted by APEC economies and discusses trends in cybersecurity approaches, where differences may be barriers and inadvertently restrict free and open trade, as well as how APEC economies can better align on cybersecurity risk management and adopt a standards and process-based approach to enhance regional trade. 
 The National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing ('ANSPDCP') announced, on 30 July 2020, that it had imposed a RON 9,680 (approx. €2,000) fine on SC Viva Credit IFN SA for failure to adequately respond to a data subject's request for erasure of its data under Article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In particular, the ANSPDCP highlighted that the operator had not provided the applicant with information on the actions taken following the request within one month (or up to three months if a reason for the delay is provided). In addition, the ANSPDCP noted the obligation, under Article 12(3) of the GDPR, to respond to data subject requests without undue delay and at the latest within one month from the receipt of the request. Therefore, the ANSPDCP requested that the company respond to the data subject request. 
 The Korea Internet & Security Agency ('KISA') published, on 31 July 2020, a privacy consultation casebook for privacy professionals ('the Casebook') covering a variety of cases where data protection issues were raised during 2019. In particular, the Casebook features chapters with cases and issues on topics including collection of data, use of personal information and its provision to third parties, deletion of data, data subject rights, and use of CCTV systems. 
 The Information Commissioner's Office ('ICO') published, on 30 July 2020, a blog post announcing the issuance of guidance ('the Guidance') on artificial intelligence ('AI') and data protection as part of the development of its wider AI framework ('the Framework'). In particular, the Framework consists of a methodology for auditing AI to ensure personal data is fairly processed, focusing on best practices including auditing tools and procedures that will be used by the ICO in investigations, detailed guidance on AI and data protection, and a toolkit providing practical support to organisations carrying out internal audits of AI systems.  More specifically, the Guidance covers the accountability and governance implications of AI; requirements for ensuring lawfulness, fairness, and transparency in AI systems; assessments for security and data minimisation in AI; and methods for ensuring individual rights are respected within AI systems. In addition, the Guidance is aimed at both those with a focus on compliance such as data protection officers ('DPO'), as well as technology specialists. Furthermore, the Guidance recommends, among other things, conducting a Data Protection Impact Assessment ('DPIA') on the AI system to demonstrate compliance, and using techniques to aid in data minimisation and effective AI development which include implementing risk management practices and starting with mapping out machine learning processes in which personal data might be used. 
 The Office of the Personal Data Protection Inspector ('PDP') issued, on 30 July 2020, a statement ('the Statement') on its work on the protection of personal data in the field of artificial intelligence ('AI'). In particular, the PDP highlighted that in order to ensure a high standard of personal data protection in the field of AI, the PDP is launching an active work process. In addition, the PDP highlighted that they, in close coordination with the target agencies, organisations, and academia, plans to conduct research at the national level, prepare relevant initiatives, and implement activities, outlining that these measures will significantly contribute to the coordination of activities in response to existing challenges and the formation of a unified approach. 
 The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner ('OAIC') released, on 31 July 2020, its Notifiable Data Breaches Report for 1 January 2020 to 30 June 2020 ('the Report'). In particular, the Report outlines that 518 breaches were notified to the OAIC, which is a 3% decrease compared to the previous six months, and that malicious or criminal attacks including cyber incidents were the leading cause of data breaches, accounting for 61% of all notifications, while data breaches resulting from human error accounted for 34% of all breaches. Furthermore, the Report notes that the health sector was the highest reporting sector, notifying 22% of all breaches, with the financial sector notifying 14% of all breaches. In addition, the Report highlights that most data breaches affected less than 100 individuals and that contact information remains the most common type of personal information involved in a data breach.  Finally, the OAIC outlined that notifications made under the My Health Records Act 2012 were not included in the Report as they are subject to specific notification requirements set out in the same. 
 The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ('FinCEN') issued, on 30 July 2020, an advisory ('the Advisory') to alert financial institutions of cybercrime and cyber-enabled crime connected to the COVID-19 ('Coronavirus') pandemic. In particular, the Advisory aims to aid financial institutions in detecting, preventing, and reporting potential Coronavirus-related criminal activity, and outlines the targeting and exploitation of remote platforms and processes, phishing, malware, and extortion, as well as business email compromise schemes. More specifically, the Advisory discusses unsolicited emails and digital manipulation of identity documentation, among other things, as well as providing financial institutions with information on how to deal with such security incidents. 
 The Spanish National Cybersecurity Institute ('INCIBE') announced, on 30 July 2020, that it had issued a guide ('the Guide') on cybersecurity for the industrial sector. In particular, INCIBE outlined that industries have been adopting new technologies in order to quickly manage their production, stock of materials, and location, establishing at the same time communication between their headquarters and departments in different geographical locations. In addition, the Guide addresses, among other things, the reasons why cybersecurity is important for the industry sector, the most relevant threats, and the importance of cybersecurity training and awareness. 
 The Swedish data protection authority ('Datainspektionen') issued, on 31 July 2020, guidance on camera surveillance in public transport ('the Guidance'). In particular, the Guidance highlights that from 1 August 2020, in some cases public transport operators do not need to apply for a permit for camera surveillance and that this exception applies when the surveillance is to take place for crime prevention purposes or is aimed at preventing or detecting disturbances of public order and safety or accidents. In addition, the Guidance notes that the exemption from the permit requirement applies if the monitoring takes place in a number of limited circumstances, such as in an airport or in a station, terminal, or stop area intended for travel by public transport by road, rail, water, tramway, or metro.  Moreover, the Guidance notes that in order to be allowed to surveil in order to prevent, deter, or detect criminal activity or to investigate or prosecute crime, it is generally required that the guarded place is exposed to crime. 
 Insurance Europe announced, on 30 July 2020, that it had issued its response ('the Response') to the European Commission's public consultation on common European data spaces. In particular, Insurance Europe outlined that it welcomes the objectives of the Commission's roadmap, which aims to make more data held by the public sector available for research and innovative uses, as well as to enhance overall data use in the economy by lowering transaction costs, addressing interoperability and standardisation, and facilitating voluntary data sharing. However, Insurance Europe recalls that the realisation of the above objectives depends on the specific mechanism or instrument that is adopted, as the nature of certain policy options is not sufficiently clear at this point, such as in the case of the creation of European coordination bodies, as well as in relation to a common European consent form. 
 The National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing ('ANSPDCP') announced, on 30 July 2020, that is has imposed a RON 9,686.60 (approx. €2,000) fine on Romanian Post National Company for its failure to implement adequate technical and organisational measures to safeguard personal data under Article 32 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR').

 The Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation ('CDEI') published, on 29 July 2020, its June repository ('the Repository') on novel use-cases of artificial intelligence ('AI') and data to counter and mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 ('Coronavirus') pandemic. In particular, the Repository highlights a move of the focus of use-cases from managing the immediate public health crisis towards building future resilience, whilst the majority of the same are still related to health and social care. In relation to the health and social care sector, the Repository lists developments, including the Strategic Commands Innovation Hub ('the jHub') partnering with NHSx to coordinate and facilitate the secure transfer of epidemiology data from third-party Coronavirus apps to NHSx (Project OASIS), and the development of Skin Analytics aiming to reduce delays in skin cancer detection during the Coronavirus outbreak, through a series of clinically validated AI algorithms that can help identify skin cancer. In addition, and in relation to infrastructure developments, the Repository outlines cases such as the creation of a centralised UK database containing chest images from X-ray, CT, and MRI scans, aiming at improving healthcare, and the development of a new secure analytics platform for electronic health records, which will allow trusted researchers to safely run large-scale computation across these records, thus improving safe health data sharing. 
 The National Information Security Standardisation Technical Committee of China ('TC260') released, on 29 July 2020, a draft national standard for mobile apps' permission systems ('the Draft Standard'). In particular, the TC260 noted that the Draft Standard is meant to reduce personal information and privacy risks associated with improper access to mobile apps. Specifically, the Draft Standard outlines the basic principles and general requirements for permission systems including increased user authorisation as well as explicit access requirements for sensitive personal information.

 The Hungarian National Tax and Customs Administration ('NAV') issued, on 6 July 2020, a Statement on the amendments of Act CXXVII of 2007 on Value Added Tax ('the VAT Act') that entered into force on 1 July 2020 ('the Amendments Statement'). In particular, NAV announced that under the amended VAT Act, the monetary condition for the obligation to provide information is abolished and that all invoices issued by a taxable person to another domestic taxable person for a domestic transaction (excluding intra-community supplies of goods), regardless of the VAT content of the invoice, must be reported to NAV. Moreover, NAV announced that because the COVID-19 ('Coronavirus') emergency situation prevented taxpayers to adequately prepare for the new legal obligation, it will grant a transition period at least until 30 September 2020, during which it will not impose a penalty if the taxpayer fails to fulfil their obligation to provide the required account data.  The NAV issued, on 8 July 2020, an additional Statement ('the Additional Statement') highlighting that the amendments of the VAT Act require that the first eight digits of the tax number of the person purchasing a product or using a service must be indicated on the invoice issued for a domestic transaction. However, NAV stressed that this is only necessary if a person subject to VAT acquires a product or uses a service, and held that an invoice can therefore continue to be issued without a customer tax number if the person acquiring the product and using the service is not a VAT payer. Furthermore, the NAV provided examples for situations in which the requirements do not apply such as a national or foreign private person or an international organisation.  Finally, NAV held that if a customer who purchases the product and uses a service declares, orally or in writing, that they do not have a tax number or are not subject to VAT in a specific transaction, the invoice does not have to include a customer tax number. 
 The Electronic Frontier Foundation ('EFF') issued, on 29 July 2020, a statement in relation to Proposition 24 for the California Privacy Rights Act ('CPRA') which seeks to amend the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ('CCPA'), noting that it does not support it, nor does it oppose it. In particular, the EFF highlighted that the CPRA does not do enough to advance the data privacy of California consumers as it is a mixed bag of partial steps backwards and forwards and includes some but not most of the strengthening amendments urged by privacy advocates. Furthermore, the EFF outlined that the CPRA would expand 'pay for privacy' schemes, erode the right to delete personal information, provide weaker biometric privacy, and not empower consumers to sue businesses that violate privacy rights. However, the EFF noted that the CPRA also provides for an opt-out right for sensitive information and data sharing and also expands the private right of action in relation to data breaches. 
 The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations ('EFPIA') issued, on 29 July 2020, a statement on the Court Justice of the European Union ('CJEU') ruling of 16 July 2020 in Data Protection Commissioner v. Facebook Ireland Limited, Maximillian Schrems (C-311/18) ('the Schrems II Case'), urging the European authorities to collaborate with US authorities in order to find a long-term basis for transatlantic data transfers and to make elaborate sectoral contractual clauses. In particular, EFPIA highlighted that, in light of the COVID-19 ('Coronavirus') pandemic, disruption to data flows can jeopardise public health and that international data transfers are important for the improvement of treatment, patient safety, monitoring of drug reactions, and enabling innovative therapies. 
 The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of New Zealand ('OPCNZ') released, on 30 July 2020, a statement welcoming the findings of an investigation into the COVID-19 ('Coronavirus') patient privacy breach. In particular, the OPCNZ highlighted that a confidential list of details including the names, dates of birth, ages, and quarantine locations of 18 active confirmed cases of Coronavirus had been leaked. Furthermore, the OPCNZ outlined that the Privacy Act 1993 ('the Act') and the Health Information Privacy Code 1994 both include exceptions for the disclosure of information where necessary to prevent or lessen a serious threat to public health. However, the OPCNZ noted that the findings of the investigation, which were that the motivations behind each disclosure, had been political.  Privacy Commissioner, John Edwards, stated, ''The State Services Commission has referred the report to my office to consider what further action, if any, under the Act is appropriate. [However], the Privacy Commissioner has no ability to issue penalties against individuals or organisations and has no jurisdiction over Members of Parliament. It remains open to any of the individuals whose information was subject to the breaches to make complaints to my office.'' 
 The European Data Protection Board ('EDPB') published, on 28 July 2020, a letter ('the Letter') in response to questions from Sophie in ‘t Veld, Olivier Chastel, Moritz Körner, Maite Pagazaurtundúa, Michal Šimečka, and Ramona Strugariu, members of the European Parliament ('MEPs'), on the possible expansion of the Prüm framework. In particular, the Letter recalls that the EDPB has not been consulted, formally or informally, by the Council of the European Union or the European Commission on this matter. However, the Letter outlines that it is essential that the Prüm framework undergoes a comprehensive and independent evaluation with regard to its compliance with the current data protection acquis, prior to any envisioned expansion or amendment.  In addition, the Letter highlights that whether the Prüm legal framework may be expanded to include retrospective facial recognition, in line with EU law, would depend on the details of the possible expansion and data protection safeguards foreseen. Moreover, the Letter states that the addition of retrospective facial recognition for the purpose of identifying a person within the Prüm legal framework would require a dedicated legal basis under EU law, as well as a thorough impact assessment, in order to ensure that the necessity and proportionality of such measure, and the essence of the fundamental right to data protection are respected.  Finally, the Letter reminds that the EDPB stands ready to provide further in-depth guidance, should a legislative proposal be envisioned, as well as that it will prepare guidelines on the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement authorities. 
 The European Banking Authority ('EBA') announced, on 29 July 2020, that it had called on financial institutions to finalise preparations for the end of the transition period between the EU and the UK, that will expire on 31 December 2020. In particular, the EBA reminds to UK-authorised payment and electronic money institutions wishing to continue to offer services to EU-based customers that it is illegal for them to provide payment or electronic money services in the EU after 31 December 2020, unless they have been adequately authorised beforehand by an EU competent authority.

 The Monetary Authority of Singapore ('MAS') announced, on 28 July 2020, that it has revoked the Capital Markets Services ('CMS') licence of Apical Asset Management Pte. Ltd for serious breaches of MAS' anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism ('AML/CFT') requirements. In particular, MAS highlighted that Apical Asset Management did not have basic AML/CFT policies and procedures in place, which exposed Apical Asset Management to the risk of receiving and/or laundering the proceeds of crime. Furthermore, MAS outlined Apical Asset Management had not conducted an enterprise-wide AML/CFT risk assessment, assessed its customers to determine whether they presented a higher risk, conducted enhanced monitoring of a fund related to a politically exposed person for a significant length of time, or subjected its AML/CFT controls to independent audits to assess their effectiveness. 
 The Danish Data Protection Authority ('Datatilsynet') issued, on 29 July 2020, its decision ('the Decision') expressing serious criticism of MaCom A/S for passing on parts of upper secondary schools students' assignments to researchers from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen for development of plagiarism programs. In particular, the Datatilsynet found that answering questions can be regarded as personal data, as they are an expression of the answering person's thinking, judgment, and critical sense. Furthermore, the Datatilsynet noted in its assessment, that, in relation to the degree of seriousness of violation, MaCom could not account for the number of extracts that were disclosed or the number of times the disclosure took place. However, the Datatilsynet considered, among other things, that the information had been passed on for scientific purposes and for a societal purpose, and that the transfer has taken place in pseudonymised form, to be mitigating circumstances. 
 The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry ('METI') released on 29 July 2020, draft guidelines on cyber/physical security for smart appliances ('the Smart Appliance Guidelines') and the privacy governance guidebook ('the Guidebook'). In particular, the Smart Appliance Guidelines highlights threats related to user privacy, data security, and Internet of Things ('IoT'), and specifies methods for business operators and service providers to minimise cybersecurity risks and ensure the protection of personal information and privacy. Correspondingly, the Guidebook notes that it is meant to aid companies, that provide products and services by utilising personal data, comply with privacy and data protection legislation. Particularly, the Guidebook recommends the appointment of an individual responsible for privacy protection and the adoption of Privacy by Design and Privacy Impact Assessments to protect customer privacy and data.  Public comments for the Smart Appliance Guideline can be submitted here until 31 August 2020 and for the Guidebook here until 12 August 2020. 
 None of your business ('NOYB') published, on 28 July 2020, an exchange of letters ('the Letters') in which Maximilian Schrems asks the Irish Data Protection Commissioner ('DPC') to take action with regards to his complaint against Facebook Ireland Ltd., filed on 25 June 2013, following the Court of Justice of the European Union's ('CJEU') judgment in Data Protection Commissioner v. Facebook Ireland Limited, Maximillian Schrems (C-311/18) ('the Schrems II Case') on international data transfers. In particular, Schrems states that the CJEU highlighted that it was within the DPC's power to stop data transfers to the US by making a decision on the Standard Contractual Clauses that Facebook relied on and that the DPC has a duty to take such action.  Furthermore, Schrems requests a clear outline of the steps that the DPC will take to implement the CJEU's judgment, noting that there are no clear steps under Irish procedural law, and highlights that in its first response on the matter, the DPC refused to outline such steps. Additionally, Schrems therefore submitted a legal request asking the DPC to provide any remaining documentation provided to it by Facebook since 25 June 2013 regarding the complaint, and to clarify the legal basis that Facebook relies on for their EU-US data transfers by 31 July 2020. Moreover, Schrems highlights that this information is required to be kept by Facebook under Article 30(1)(e) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), and made public under Articles 13(1)(f) and 14(1) of the GDPR.  Finally, Schrems asks for a final decision to be issued by the DPC on 1 October 2020. 
 The Secretary General of Council of Europe ('CoE') published, on 9 July 2020, its annual report ('the Annual Report') and toolkit ('the Toolkit') aiming to give guidance with respect to human rights particularly during the COVID-19 ('Coronavirus') pandemic. In particular, the Annual Report highlights, among other things, the fundamental rights standards, including privacy and data protection. More specifically, the Annual Report states that data protection safeguards must be implemented to protect people when adopting extraordinary measures such as contact tracing apps, that confidentiality of health data must be preserved, and that emphasis should be given to children's rights when using online learning tools. In addition, the Toolkit highlights that large-scale processing of personal data by means of artificial intelligence should only take place when scientific evidence proves that potential public health benefits override the benefits of other less intrusive solutions. 
 The Danish Data Protection Authority ('Datatilsynet') announced, on 28 July 2020, that it had recommended Arp-Hansen Hotel Group A/S for a fine of DKK 1,100,000 (approx. €147,800) and reported it to the police for failure to delete the personal data of 500,000 customers in violation of Article 5(1)(e) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In particular, the Datatilsynet highlighted that during an inspection, it reviewed a number of systems with a view to examining whether Arp-Hansen had sufficient procedures to ensure that personal data were not stored for longer than was necessary for the purposes for which the data were processed. Furthermore, the Datatilsynet noted that, during the course of the inspection, it discovered that a booking system contained a lot of personal data that should have been deleted in accordance with Arp-Hansen's own set deletion deadlines and was also able to establish that there were so-called customer profiles, which, after Arp-Hansen's own deletion deadlines, should have been deleted several years earlier. 
 The Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') announced, on 25 June 2020, that Novartis AG, had agreed to pay over $112 million to resolve charges that it violated the books and records and internal accounting controls of the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act ('FCPA').

Furthermore, the Order notes that, from 2013 to 2015, former Alcon Asia business' internal accounting control weaknesses associated with Equipment Financing Arrangements ('EFA') in China resulted in, among other things, forged contracts and significant EFA accounts receivable balance. As part of the Order, Novartis consented to comply with a three-year undertaking to self-report on the status of its remediation and implementation of compliance measures. Finally, the SEC outlined that subsidiaries of Novartis and Alcon entered into deferred prosecution agreements with the Department of Justice ('DOJ') and have agreed to pay more than $233 million in criminal fines in relation to the FPCA violations. 
 The Data Protection Office ('the Office') published, on 20 July 2020, a communique ('the Communique') on Data Protection (Fees) Regulations 2020 ('the Regulations'). In particular, the Office highlighted that the Regulations, which concern the new fees for registration of controllers and processors, will come into force on 1 August 2020, and that all controllers and processors will be required to make a fresh registration as from this date. In addition, the Communique noted that failure to register or renew the registration certificate(s) after the moratory period of three months from the commencement of the Regulations, may amount to an offence under the Data Protection Act 2017 and consequently, a fine not exceeding MUR 200,000 (approx. €4,230) and imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years on conviction may be imposed. 
 The Personal Information Protection Commission ('PPC') issued, on 29 July 2020, administrative measures pursuant to Article 42(2) of the Act on the Protection of Personal Information (Act No. 57 of 2003 as amended in 2016) ('APPI') for the illegal posting of personal information online without consent. In particular, the PPC highlighted that two businesses had posted information on their website about the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings without the consent of third parties. Consequently, the PPC has ordered the immediate cessation of the websites operation and has requested the notification and publication of the purpose of processing as well as the consent of the third parties. Finally, the PPC emphasised that the companies must respond to the administrative measures before 27 August 2020, or criminal charges pursuant to Article 84 of the APPI will be taken. 
 The Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') announced, on 2 July 2020, that Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. had agreed to pay over $21 million to resolve charges that it had violated the books and records and internal accounting controls of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 1977 ('FCPA'). In particular, the SEC Order ('the Order') states that, from 2010 to 2014, Alexion's subsidiary made payments to foreign officials in order to influence them to provide favourable regulatory treatment of their primary drug, Soliris. Furthermore, the Order details that their subsidiary continued this practice in Russia from 2011 to 2015. As a consequence, the Order notes that Alexion's subsidiaries maintained false books and records, and had insufficient internal accounting controls to detect and prevent these payments, which resulted in Alexion being unjustly enriched by over $14 million. Moreover, the Order outlines that Alexion's inadequate internal accounting controls resulted in Alexion's subsidiaries in Brazil and Columbia's failure to maintain accurate books and records regarding third-party payments. 
 The National Center for Personal Data Protection ('NCPDP') announced, on 29 July 2020, that it had initiated a public consultation on a draft decision establishing cases of personal data processing for which notification is not required ('the Draft Decision'). In particular, the NCPDP noted that, under Article 23(5) of the Law of 8 July 2011 No. 133 on Personal Data Protection ('the Law'), notification is not necessary if the purpose of processing is to keep a register intended to inform the general public, provided that the processing is limited to the data necessary to maintain such a register. In addition, the NCPDP highlighted that, per Decision No. 200 of 14 December 2015, it established cases of personal data processing for which notification is required. 
 The National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing ('ANSPDCP') announced, on 27 July 2020, that it has fined SC Cntar Tarom SA RON 24,180 (approx. €5,000) for implementing inadequate technical and organisational measures to safeguard personal data under Article 32 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In particular, the ANSPDCP highlighted that Tarom's failure to implement such measures led to unauthorised disclosure of the data of five Tarom passengers and that, therefore, Tarom should pay the fine and implement remedial measures, including training its employees and undertaking risk assessment procedures. 
 Insurance Europe announced, on 29 July 2020, that it had issued its response ('the Response') to the European Commission's action plan for a comprehensive EU policy on anti-money laundering and countering terrorist financing ('AML/CFT'). In particular, Insurance Europe outlined that the action plan must take account of the fact that, while the banking sector is clearly vulnerable to AML/CFT, insurers' business models and products do not lend themselves easily to such operations. Therefore, Insurance Europe highlights that there is a risk that the European Banking Authority ('EBA') will enforce a banking-related supervisory approach across all sectors, regardless of their specificities. 
 The Ministry of Communication and Information Technology ('Kominfo') issued, on 28 July 2020, a statement calling on organisations to play a role in efforts to protect personal data.

In addition, Kominfo stated that the draft bill for the Personal Data Protection Act ('the PDP Bill'), once enacted, will act as a legal umbrella in the effort to protect personal data and that the House of Representatives was aiming for the PDP Bill to be passed this year. 
 Senate Bill ('SB') 8450C for An Act to Amend the Public Health Law in relation to the Confidentiality of Contact Tracing Information ('the Bill') passed, on 23 July 2020, the New York State Senate and Assembly and will be delivered to the New York State Governor for signature. In particular, the Bill would, among other things, ensure that information collected through contact tracing for COVID-19 ('Coronavirus') is kept confidential and may not be disclosed except as necessary to carry out contact tracing or a permitted purpose, and would authorise an individual to waive confidentiality in a written, informed, and voluntary waiver in plain language understandable to the individual. Moreover, the Bill would authorise the disclosure, possession, or use of contact tracing information that has been de-identified, for public health or public health research purposes, would require technical safeguards against re-identification of data, and would prohibit law enforcement agents and entities or immigration authorities from participating in contact tracing and for contact tracing information to be provided to such bodies, except for permitted purposes. 
 The Quebec Commission on Access to Information ('CAI') announced, on 28 July 2020, that it had published a guide on Biometrics: Principles to be Respected and Legal Obligations of Organizations ('the Guide') as well as updated its declaration form ('the Form') for a bank of biometric characteristics or measurements. In particular, the Guide seeks to make public bodies and businesses aware of their responsibilities and obligations in terms of protecting personal information derived from biometrics. Moreover, the Guide aims to support those responsible for the implementation of projects that involve the use of biometrics in order to adequately complete the Form. 
 The Information Commissioner's Office ('ICO') announced on Twitter, on 27 July 2020, updated resources ('the Resources') to help organisations prepare for the end of the transition period, on 31 December 2020, for the UK's formal departure from the EU ('Brexit').

 U.S. Senator, Josh Hawley, announced, on 28 July 2020, that he will introduce the bill for the Behavioral Advertising Decisions Are Downgrading Services (BAD ADS) Act ('the Bill') to the U.S. Senate. In particular, the Bill seeks to remove the immunity under Section 230 of the Communications Act of 1934 from companies that display manipulative and behavioural ads, or provide data to be used for them. In addition, Hawley noted that, "big tech's manipulative advertising regime comes with a massive hidden price tag for consumers while providing almost no return to anyone but themselves. From privacy violations to harming children to suppression of speech, the ramifications are very real. These kinds of manipulative ads are not what U.S. Congress had in mind when passing Section 230, and now is the time to put a stop to this abuse." 
 The Electronic Government Agency and Information Knowledge Society ('AGESIC') announced, on 28 July 2020, that the Inter-American Development Bank ('IAD') and the Organization of American States ('OAS') have released their Cybersecurity Report: Risks, Progress and the Way Forward in Latin America and the Caribbean ('the Report'). In particular, the Report notes that Uruguay is leading the region in four of the five areas of the cybersecurity maturity model, which include cybersecurity policy and strategy, cybernetic culture and society, education, training, and cybersecurity skills, legal and regulatory frameworks, and standards, organisations, and technologies. Moreover, the Report highlights that Uruguay has a national computer security incident response team ('CSIRT'), the CERTuy under the remit of AGESIC, and a Security Operations Center. In addition, the Report indicates that, although Uruguay does not have a national strategy, it has developed an organised cybersecurity framework with reference to international standards. 
 The German Data Protection Conference ('DSK') issued, on 28 July 2020, a statement ('the Statement') on the Court of Justice of the European Union's ('CJEU') judgment in Data Protection Commissioner v. Facebook Ireland Limited, Maximillian Schrems (C-311/18) ('the Schrems II Case') and a first assessment on the impact the decision has on data transfers to the US and other third countries. In particular, the DSK held that transfers of personal data to the US based on the Privacy Shield are inadmissible and must cease based on the CJEU's decision that US law does not provide protection that is in essence equal to EU law. Furthermore, the DSK held that Standard Contractual Clauses ('SCCs') may in principle continue to be used, however it emphasised the CJEU's ruling on the responsibility of the transferring and recepient parties to assess whether the rights of data subjects have an equal level of protection in the third country, which is a precondition for deciding if guarantees included in SCCs can be realised or if further measures need to be taken. In this regard, the DSK highlighted that in cases of data transfers to the US, SCCs without further measures are insufficient.  Moreover, the DSK highlighted that the CJEU's findings also have an impact on Binding Corporate Rules ('BCRs') and additional measures need to be taken if the rights of data subject are not protected to the same level in a third country. In addition, the DSK held that data transfers to the US and other third countries under Article 49 of the GDPR continue to be admissible if all conditions are fulfilled in each individual case. The DSK equally found that responsible persons that wish to continue transferring data to the US or other third countries need to assess immediately if they fulfill the requirements, as the CJEU did not provide for a transitional period.  Finally, the DSK highlighted that supervisory authorities play a key role in the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') and data transfers and announced that, upon harmonisation with other European supvervisory authorities, they should also advise on specific questions on data transfers, also endorsing the FAQs ('the FAQs') issued by the European Data Protection Board ('EDPB'). 
 The French data protection authority ('CNIL') adopted, on 28 July 2020, three referentials for the health sector ('the Standards'). In particular, the Standards include a non-binding standard on the processing of personal data by medical and paramedical clinics, which replaces the simplified norm NS-50 for medical professionals and paramedicals working on an independent basis. Furthermore, the Standards include two standards on data retention periods, the first on retention periods for processing activities in the health sector outside of the research domain and the second on data retention periods for processing activities for the purposes of research, study, and analysis in the health sector.  In addition, CNIL published a practical guide ('the Guide') on data retention periods in general which offers guidance on, among other things, the principle of data minimisation, defining retention periods, and the retention period standards.  You can read the press release here, the standard on processing by medical and paramedical clinics here, the standard on data retention periods in the health sector here, the standard on data retention periods for research purposes here, and the Guide here, all only available in French.
 The Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport ('DCMS') published, on 22 July 2020, the UK Government's response ('the Response') to the public consultation on implementing the European Electronic Communications Code Directive ('the Directive').

 The German Federal Court of Justice ('BGH') issued, on 27 July 2020, two decisions on delisting requests against Google LLC and sent questions under the preliminary reference procedure to the Court of Justice of the European Union ('CJEU'). In particular, in the first decision, the BGH found that the claimant's asserted claim regarding the delisting of the disputed links does not result from Article 17(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), referring to the CJEU and German Federal Constitutional Court jurisprudence, according to which Article 17(1) of the GDPR requires a comprehensive consideration of fundamental rights based on all relevant circumstances of the individual case, and taking into account the severity of the interference with the fundamental rights of the data subject on the one hand, and the fundamental rights of the defendants, the interests of its users, and the public, as well as the fundamental rights of the providers of the content demonstrated in the contested result links on the other. Moreover, the BGH held that there is no presumption of a priority for the protection interests of the concerned person, but that the conflicting fundamental rights are to be weighed up equally and that it would follow from the principle of equal consideration that the person responsible for a search engine does not have to take action until they become aware of an obvious and at first glance recognisable violation of the rights of the concerned person.  Furthermore, in the second decision, the BGH held that the CJEU must clarify whether it is compatible with the rights of the concerned person to the respect of their private life and protection of their personal data, to weigh up the conflicting rights and interests under the European Charter of Fundamental Rights when the link that is requested to be removed leads to content that contains factual claims and factual value judgments whose truthfulness and legality is disputed and the legal situation in case of involvement by third parties. 
 The Government of the Republic of Croatia ('the Government') announced, on 27 July 2020, that it had launched the Croatian 'Stop COVID-19' contact tracing app. In particular, the Government outlined that the app is voluntary, transparent, and temporary, as well as that it uses temporary and anonymous data for notification of COVID-19 ('Coronavirus') exposure. In addition, the Government highlighted that the app uses Bluetooth technology, as well as that it does not collect personal data and ensures cross-border interoperability. Moreover, the Government recalled that the app was assessed by the Personal Data Protection Agency ('AZOP') in order to ensure its full compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). 
 The Financial Markets Authority ('AMF') and the French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority ('ACPR') issued, on 27 July 2020, a notice aiming to remind operators of ATMs which allow the purchase or sale of digital assets, such as Bitcoins, of their obligations. In particular, the AMF and ACPR highlighted that, among other things, such operators must register with the AMF, which entails setting up internal control procedures to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering and combatting the financing of terrorism ('AML/CFT') rules, as well as enabling the freezing of assets. In addition, the AMF and ACPR emphasised that any operator engaging in such activities without being registered is liable to a two-year prison sentence and a fine of €30,000. 
 The European Commission ('the Commission') launched, on 23 July 2020, a public consultation on a proposal for a legal act of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union laying down requirements for artificial intelligence ('AI'). In particular, the Commission outlined that the overall policy objective is to ensure the development and uptake of lawful and trustworthy AI across the single market through the creation of an ecosystem of trust. Specifically, the Commission highlighted that the consultation aims to, among other things, provide legal certainty for businesses that are marketing their AI-enabled products, or using such solutions in the EU as regards the rules applicable to such products and services.

 The European Commission's Joint Research Centre ('JRC') published, on 27 July 2020, a report ('the Report') on artificial intelligence ('AI') and digital transformation in the context of COVID-19 ('Coronavirus'). In particular, the JRC highlighted that the Report provides an update on developments in the sector that has undergone a transformation in a matter of a couple of months and follows on from its previous report 'Artificial Intelligence: a European Perspective' published 18 months ago. In addition, the Report focuses on areas such as the acceleration of AI adoption and digital transformation, the crucial role of governance in data processing, and the European approach to AI.  Moreover, the Report, in respect of the need to strengthen European technological and data sovereignty, calls for strong coordination to strengthen European technological and data sovereignty and address the increasing inequalities therein, as well as highlighting how the response to the Coronavirus pandemic, including the lockdown and accelerated digital transition, has widened the gap between the wealthier and poorer segments in society. 
 The Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data ('PCPD') published, on 27 July 2020, its guidelines on the prevention of the COVID-19 ('Coronavirus') pandemic with body temperature detection and collection of related personal information from premise operators ('the Guidelines'). In particular, the PCPD clarified in its Guidelines that operators of premises, such as restaurants, have incorporated temperature checking measures including the collection of other personal and biometric data, and in such cases operators must comply with the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance 1997 as amended in 2013 ('PDPO') and its principles. Furthermore, the PCPD noted that the Guidelines establish that it is reasonable and legitimate for operators to collect temperatures and personal information of visitors where it is necessary, appropriate, and proportionate to the purpose for collection. In addition, the Guidelines establish that personal information may not be disclosed without explicit and voluntary consent for purposes beyond the prevention of the spread of Coronavirus, and where visitors have become infected it is sufficient to issue a notice that a visitor was infected and must not disclose their personal information. 
 The Spanish data protection authority ('AEPD') announced, on 28 July 2020, that it had published an updated version of its guide on the use of cookies ('the Updated Guide') in order to adapt it to the European Data Protection Board's ('EDPB') Guidelines 05/2020 on Consent under Regulation 2016/679 ('the Guidelines on Consent'). In particular, the Updated Guide addresses the amendments implemented by the EDPB in its Guidelines on Consent, namely the validity of consent provided by the data subject when interacting with cookie walls and the issue of scrolling or swiping through a webpage as a clear and affirmative action of consent.  Specifically, the Updated Guide provides that cookie walls cannot be used, since they do not offer a valid alternative to consent. The AEPD stressed that these criteria are of particular importance in relation to cases where the denial of access would prevent the exercise of a right legally recognised to a user, such as when access to a website is the only means provided in order to exercise the right. In addition, the Updated Guide recalls that the EDPB established that continued browsing cannot constitute a valid way to obtain consent, and therefore Section 3.2.3(e) of the Updated Guide was amended accordingly.  Lastly, the AEPD recalled that the Updated Guide must be implemented no later than 31 October 2020. 
 The Central Bank of the Russian Federation ('the Central Bank') issued, on 27 July 2020, a statement on a draft directive on the requirements for programs for electronic computing machines used to provide investment advice ('the Draft Directive').

In addition, the Draft Regualation is expected to increase the transparency of transactions, protect consumers of financial products from unfair practices, and promote the development of innovative technologies in investment activities. Moreover, the Draft Directive highlights the need to prevent unauthorised access to the program. 
 The Norwegian data protection authority ('Datatilsynet') published, on 27 July 2020, Questions & Answers ('the Q&As') on the Court of Justice of the European Union's ('CJEU') judgment in Data Protection Commissioner v. Facebook Ireland Limited, Maximillian Schrems (C-311/18) ('the Schrems II Case'). In particular, the Q&As outline recommendations for transferring data to the US and to countries recognised as affording adequate protection, the obligation of the data importers, as well as exceptions to the rules applicable to transfers. More specifically, the Q&As highlighted that the Schrems II Case is directly applicable, with no transition period, which means that it is not possible to use the EU-US Privacy Shield and that data exporters already transferring data to non-authorised third countries must either stop transferring such data and request that the data importer return or delete the data already transferred, or carry out necessary assessments and actions. In addition, and in relation to the necessary assessments and actions to be taken by data exporters, the Q&As noted that, in cases where a country has not been recognised as affording adequate protection, data exporters must, among other things, rely on Article 46 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR') as well as assess whether the data importer or any subcontractors are subject to laws, rules, or systems which undermine the importer's obligations in relation to the transfer, or lower the level of protection. 
 The Information Commissioner ('the Commissioner') issued, on 27 July 2020, its statement on the Court of Justice of the European Union's ('CJEU') judgment in Data Protection Commissioner v. Facebook Ireland Limited, Maximillian Schrems (C-311/18) ('the Schrems II Case'). In particular, the Commissioner outlined steps that Isle of Man businesses need to follow, including determining if the Privacy Shield has been relied upon for data transfers and, if so, considering whether it is necessary to continue to transfer personal data where an alternative would have to be pursued, such the derogation set out in Article 49 of the Applied General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('the Applied GDPR') or in Schedule 10 of the GDPR and LED Implementing Regulations 2018. In addition, the Commissioner highlighted that any reliance upon Standard Contractual Clauses ('SCC') or Binding Corporate Rules ('BCRs') to transfer personal data must also be reviewed to ensure they provide appropriate safeguards, emphasising that this is not limited to transfers to the US. 
 The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services ('HHS') announced, on 27 July 2020, that Lifespan Health System Affiliated Covered Entity had paid $1,040,000 to the HHS' Office for Civil Rights ('OCR') and agreed to implement a corrective action plan to settle violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 Privacy and Security Rules ('the HIPPA Rules') as a result of the theft of an unencrypted laptop ('the Settlement'). In particular, the OCR notes that on 21 April 2017, Lifespan Corporation, the parent company and business associate of Lifespan Health System, filed a breach report with the OCR concerning the theft of an affiliated hospital employee's laptop containing electronic protected health information ('ePHI') including patients' names, medical record numbers, demographic information, and medication information, outlining that the breach affected 20,431 individuals. In addition, the Settlement highlights that Lifespan Health System did not, among other things, implement policies and procedures to encrypt all devices used for work purposes, implement policies and procedures to track or inventory all devices that access the network which contains ePHI, and have in place the proper business associate agreements between Lifespan Corporation and the Lifespan healthcare provider affiliates that are members of Lifespan Healh System. 
 The Ministry of Health launched, on 27 July 2020, HaMagen 2, the second version of a contact tracing app which will notify individuals of the exact time and location of when they have been in the presence of someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 ('Coronavirus'). In particular, HaMagen 2 cross-checks the GPS history of the mobile phone with historical geographical data of diagnosed patients, although no data is sent back to the Ministry of Health from the phone. More specifically, HaMagen 2 requires authorisation to access tracking services, internet access, and bluetooth services on the user device. Furthermore, users will be able to review, confirm, or reject notifications, and following confirmations, users will be referred to the Ministry of Health's website where exposures can be reported. As part of the transparency policy, the Ministry of Health has, among other things, published the app's source code and outlined that cross-checking, location, and proximity information, which is kept for the last two weeks only, is only stored on the user device and is not forwarded. In addition, the Ministry of Health indicated that it is aware of the existence of breach attempts, and that it is doing its best to protect the app. 
 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ('CFPB') announced, on 24 July 2020, its plan to issue an advance notice of proposed rulemaking later this year on consumer-authorised access to financial records, following a symposium held earlier this year on the same. In particular, the CFPB will seek stakeholder input on, among other things, ways that they may effectively and efficiently implement the financial access rights described in Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, information regarding the possible scope of data that might be made subject to protected access, and inquire into how issues of regulatory uncertainty with respect to Section 1033 and its interaction with other statutes may be impacting the market to the detriment of consumers. Finally, the CFPB also published a report ('the Report') on the symposium which summarises views from stakeholders on a variety of subjects including data access and scope, disclosure and informed consent, privacy, security, data minimisation, and accountability. 
 The Office for Personal Data Protection ('UOOU') published, on 24 July 2020, a statement highlighting the controller's responsibility for data processing performed using an external information system provider. In particular, the UOOU noted that in light of Article 5(2) and Article 24 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), the controller is always responsible for the processing of personal data and has a duty to demonstrate that such processing is carried out in accordance with the GDPR. In addition, the UOOU stated that when choosing an information system, it is necessary to assess its functionalities and settings with regard to the wording of Article 25 of the GDPR and the principles under Article 5(1) of the GDPR, and emphasised that fulfilment of all personal data protection obligations cannot be automatically assumed on the sole ground that the same information system is also used by other controllers. 
 The National Authority for Data Protection and Freedom of Information ('NAIH') issued, on 16 July 2020, a decision ('the Decision') in a procedure with Google Ireland Ltd. In particular, NAIH determined that Google Ireland has violated the complainant's data protection rights to access information. Moreover, the Decision states that NAIH had failed to meet an administrative deadline and must pay damages of HUF 10,000 (approx. €29). In addition, the Decision notes that there is no administrative appeal against the Decision but that it can be challenged in an administrative lawsuit within 30 days.  Dr. Márton Domokos, Senior Counsel at CMS Cameron McKenna Nabarro Olswang LLP told OneTrust DataGuidance: "The complainant's subject access request was rather complex. He had requested detailed information on what kind of ads, websites, and advertisers are processed together with his name (as an advertising keyword). The complainant was also interested in seeing how many Google AdWords advertisement Google showed when a user searched for the complainant's name, and asked information about the algorithm used by Google Ireland. Google Ireland failed to respond to the complainant's access request in due time but, eventually, it sent an answer to the complainant's questions. Despite the request of the complainant, NAIH did not request a proceeding before Google Ireland's lead supervisory authority, Ireland's Data Protection Commission, because NAIH did not find a systemic problem regarding the general subject access request policies of Google Ireland."   CORRECTION (30 July 2020)  On publication, this article erroneously stated that Google had been fined HUF 10,000 for violating the right to access information. OneTrust DataGuidance has corrected this and apologises for any inconvenience caused.

 The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ('ACCC') launched, on 27 July 2020, Federal Court proceedings against Google LLC alleging that Google misled Australian consumers in order to obtain their consent, with the aim of expanding the scope of personal information that Google could collect and combine regarding consumers' internet activity. In particular, the ACCC alleged that Google had failed to inform consumers and gain their explicit informed consent in relation to its move in 2016 to start combining personal information in consumers' Google accounts with information about those individuals' activities on non-Google sites that used Google technology, formerly DoubleClick technology, to display adverts.  In addition, the ACCC highlighted that data that had previously been kept separate, such as data about users' non-Google online activity, became linked to their names and other identifying information held by Google. Furthermore, the ACCC alleged that Google used this newly combined information to improve the commercial performance of its advertising businesses, and further misled consumers in relation to a related change to its privacy policy. In addition, the ACCC alleged that Google's conduct could have impacted millions of Australians with Google accounts.  ACCC Chair Rod Sims stated, ''The use of this new combined information allowed Google to increase significantly the value of its advertising products, from which it generated much higher profits […] The ACCC considers that consumers effectively pay for Google's services with their data, so this change introduced by Google increased the ''price'' of Google's services, without consumers' knowledge.'' 
 The Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs ('LIBE') Committee of the European Parliament issued, on 16 July 2020, an opinion ('the Opinion') on the European Commission's proposed Digital Services Act. In particular, the Opinion outlines suggestions, such as underlining that digital services and their underlying algorithms need to fully respect personal data protection and fundamental rights, emphasising that any future provision of the Digital Services Act comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In addition, the Opinion highlights the need for data minimisation and the protection of minors when registering for an online service, and suggests that the Commission incorporate the obligation upon digital service providers to store biometric data only on the device itself. 
 The European Data Protection Supervisor ('EDPS') issued, on 27 July 2020, Opinion 5/2020 ('the Opinion') on the European Commission's action plan for a comprehensive EU policy on anti-money laundering and countering terrorist financing ('AML/CFT') and the role of data protection. In particular, the EDPS welcomed the EU Commission's action plan while also highlighting the need for legislation to strike a balance between interference with the fundamental rights of privacy and personal data protection as well as the necessary AML/CFT measures in accordance with the principle of proportionality. More specifically, the EDPS recommended, among other things, that the interconnection of central bank account mechanisms and beneficial ownership registers should comply with the principles of data minimisation, accuracy as well as Privacy by Design and by Default, and that the use of public-private partnerships should occur within the boundaries of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). In addition, the EDPS encouraged the EU Commission to promote data protection principles when agreeing on international standards at the Financial Action Task Force. 
 The Icelandic data protection authority ('Persónuvernd') announced, on 24 July 2020, that it had sent a letter ('the Letter') to the State Social Security Administration ('TR') in respect of the use of information collected through IP addresses for surveillance purposes. In particular, the Letter states that, under the Act 90/2018 on Privacy and Processing of Personal Data ('the Act'), information collected through IP addresses cannot be reliable in verifying an individual's location and that, if the information examined is not verified, the responsible party is under the obligation to stop processing it and delete or correct the information as appropriate in accordance with the applicable legal provisions on public archives. In addition, the Letter notes that investigative measures taken by the TR in the event of suspicion of residence abroad, such as a request for an investigation by the National Registry of Iceland, can serve the purpose of verifying the reliability of information collected through IP addresses. 
 The Spanish data protection authority ('AEPD') issued, on 23 July 2020, a resolution ('the Resolution') in proceedings No. PS/00134/2020, fining El Real Sporting de Gijón S.A.D. €5,000 for unlawfully collecting data subjects' consent for the purpose of sending direct marketing communications. In particular, the Resolution outlines that the form submitted by Real Sporting de Gijón to members of the club did not comply with the applicable legislation, since consent did not consist in an affirmative action, and was therefore ambiguous. In fact, the Resolution highlights that the form aimed to collect data subjects' consent through their inaction, since they had to tick the relevant boxes in order to deny their consent to the sending of commercial communications. Moreover, the Resolution found that Real Sporting de Gijón's conduct amounted to a violation of Article 7 of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR').  Lastly, the Resolution imposes a fine of €5,000, which was subsequently reduced to €3,000 as a result of Real Sporting de Gijón's voluntary payment. 
 The Office of the Data Protection Authority ('ODPA') issued, on 24 July 2020, a statement on the Court of Justice of the European Union's ('CJEU') judgment in Data Protection Commissioner v. Facebook Ireland Limited, Maximillian Schrems (C-311/18) ('the Schrems II Case'). In particular, the ODPA outlined actions that organisations should take following the invalidation of the EU-US Privacy Shield ('the Privacy Shield'), including identifying whether they have been relying on the Privacy Shield for data transfers and checking the terms of service, contracts, or privacy statements for all third parties they may be using to process their data. In addition, the ODPA urged companies to consider alternatives in case of reliance on the Privacy Shield, and ensure that they accurately reflect detailed consideration of risks and safeguards, where they have been relying on Standard Contractual Clauses ('SCCs') or Binding Corporate Rules ('BCRs'). Furthermore, the ODPA highlighted that whilst the Schrems II judgment recognises SCCs as valid, it also raises significant questions around their use, and emphasised that organisations in the EEA or adequate jurisdictions must still carefully review their position and invest resources into ensuring that appropriate safeguards are in place. 
 The Privacy Protection Authority ('PPA') published, on 26 July 2020, its report ('the Report') for the period between March and June 2020 on activity during the first wave of COVID-19 ('Coronavirus').

More specifically, and regarding enforcement, the Report highlights that the PPA covered, among other things, security incidents within organisations which collect health information from customers. Furthermore, the Report reiterates that alternative measures for contact tracing are currently being examined, in the form of a second version of the Ministry of Health app, and that an in-depth investigation involving the PPA must be conducted on the impact on privacy. Expanding on this, the Report indicates that advantages of such an app include a decentralised system for the collection of location and proximity data, a consent-based system, storage and processing of data on the device which is not transferred to any party, and an optimal level of accuracy.

 The Hellenic Data Protection Authority ('HDPA') published, on 20 July 2020, a decision ('the Decision') rejecting a complaint about the alleged unlawful processing of personal data upon the entry of the complainant into 401 General Military Hospital of Athens ('the Hospital'). In particular, the Hospital had argued that in accordance to military law requirements, the Hospital needs to record information such as the name, identity number, and the reason for a hospital visit of the visitor and that the HDPA is not competent to examine this complaint as it is a matter related to national security. Further to the Hospital's argument, the HDPA noted that a limitation of its competence to decide upon matters related to national security does not contradict the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'), but highlighted that a general reliance upon national security does not suffice to exclude the jurisdiction of the HDPA.  More specifically, the HDPA highlighted that for the exclusion of the HDPA's jurisdiction to be lawful, the processing must directly be linked to activities implicating national security. In addition, the HDPA considered that the Hospital had not proved that the processing of personal data at the entrance was for national security purposes, also noting that the processing of data about the purpose of the hospital visit falls within special categories of personal data under Article 9 of the GDPR. Lastly, the HDPA found that the processing was lawful in accordance with Article 6 of the GDPR, as it gave effect to the public interest of securing hospital facilities in accordance with military regulations, as well as ordering the Hospital to designate a data protection officer ('DPO') because a single DPO for multiple services of the National Defence General Staff cannot, in accordance with Article 37 of the GDPR, ensure that the DPO effectively performs its tasks.

Barr at the Department of Justice ('DoJ') urging the Antitrust Division ('the Division') to conduct a comprehensive review of Google LLC's proposed acquisition of Fitbit, Inc.

Specifically, the Letter discusses recent reports from the EU over growing concerns of increased access to health data Google would acquire with the acquisition and promises made to ring-fence the sensitive Fitbit personal data. In addition, the Letter states that the acquisition could lessen competition to provide privacy features and may lead to a reduction in the incentives of competing wearables to safeguard user privacy and the privacy-enhancing features offered.

 The Information Commissioner's Office ('ICO') published, on 23 July 2020, a blog post on the first reports published from the ICO's regulatory sandbox ('the Sandbox'), namely, the JISC report ('the JISC Report') and the Heathrow Airport Ltd report ('the Heathrow Airport Report'). In particular, the ICO noted that during the involvement of JISC with the Sandbox, JISC developed a Wellbeing Code of Practice for universities and colleges who wish to investigate the use and analysis of student activity data in order to improve the institution's provision of student support services, this helping them protect both their privacy and wellbeing. In addition, Heathrow Airport, through its involvement with the Sandbox, developed an Automated Passenger Journey ('APJ') project which would use facial recognition technology ('FRT') to verify the passengers' identity from an ID source.  According to the Heathrow Airport Report, following conversations with the ICO, it appeared that Heathrow Airport would likely be considered as a joint controller with each of their partner airlines for the processing of personal data associated with the APJ. The ICO futher outlined the reasons for this observation, which include, among other things, the fact that Heathrow Airport would jointly, with their airline partners, be making the decision to introduce FRT-based identity verification in the terminal, and determining the means and manner through which FRT-based identity verifications take place in the terminal.
