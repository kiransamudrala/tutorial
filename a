t05.txt:Thank you. I'd like to thank Chairman Jeff Miller for his leadership on behalf of those who have served this country in military uniform, and for working with our campaign on developing real solutions for our great Veterans. Before going further today, however, I would first like to address the contributions of another group who serve this country in uniform: the men and women in blue. Our Police Officers rush into danger every day to protect our communities, and they often do it thanklessly and under relentless criticism. They save thousands of lives every year, perform countless public services every day, and yet their names will likely never appear in a single headline or media report. But I want our nation's police to know, that we thank you, and we support you, and we will always stand with you. The attack on our Dallas police is an attack on our country. Our whole nation is in mourning, and will be for a very long time. Yet, we've also seen increasing threats against our police and a substantial rise in the number of officers killed in the line of duty. America's police and law enforcement personnel are what separates civilization from total chaos  and the destruction of our country as we know it. We must remember, the police are needed the most where crime is the highest. Politicians and activists who seek to remove police or policing from a community are hurting the poorest and most vulnerable Americans. It is time for the hostility against our police, and against all members of law enforcement, to end  and to end right now. We went through an ugly chapter in our history, during Vietnam, when our troops became the victims of harassment and political agendas. For too many police today, that is their daily reality. At the same time, the tragic deaths in Louisiana and Minnesota make clear the work that must be done to ensure every American feels that their safety is protected. We were all disturbed by the images we saw. We must discuss, as well, the ongoing catastrophe of crime in our inner cities. According to the Chicago Tribune, there has already been more than 2,000 shooting victims in Chicago this year alone. This epidemic of violence destroys lives, destroys communities, and destroys opportunity for young Americans. Violent crime has increased in cities across America. The New York Times described "a startling rise in murders," in our major cities. Brutal drug cartels are spreading their reach into Virginia and Maryland. Too many Americans are trapped in fear, violence and poverty. Our inner cities have been left behind, and I am going to fight to make sure every citizen of this country has a safe home, safe school and safe community. We must maintain law and order at the highest level or we will cease to have a country. I am the law and order candidate. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, is weak, ineffective, pandering, and, as proven by her recent email scandal, which was an embarrassment not only to her, but to the nation as a whole, she is either a liar or grossly incompetent. Personally, I think she is both. Not only am I the law and order candidate, but I am also the candidate of compassion. But you can't have true compassion without providing safety for the citizens of the United States. Every kid in America should be able to securely walk the streets in their own neighborhood. Everyone will be protected equally and treated justly, without prejudice. We will be tough, we will be smart, we will be fair  and we will protect all Americans. Without safety, we have nothing! It is the job of the next President to Make America Safe Again  For Everyone. That promise of protection must include taking care of every last Veteran, which was going to be the sole topic of today's speech prior to the attack in Dallas. The men and women who have served in our armed forces represent the very best of America. Now is the time to follow their example of unity, public service and selfless devotion to our country. We made a promise to these heroes. You defend America, and America will defend you. But that promise has been broken by our politicians, like so many other promises our country has made  not only to its veterans, but to its citizens as a whole. President Obama has allowed our Veterans Affairs health care system to deny help and support to those who deserve it most. Hillary Clinton recently said of the VA scandal that "it's not been as widespread as it has been made out to be." She actually thinks that the Veterans Health Administration is well run  that's because she has been part of the rigged system. Perhaps it is easy for politicians to lose touch with reality when they are being paid millions of dollars to read speeches to Wall Street executives  instead of spending time with real people in real pain. The disconnect in America is deep. There are two Americas: the ruling class, and the groups it favors, and then everyone else. The VA scandals that have occurred on this Administration's watch are widespread and inexcusable. An internal memo from a senior VA official describes "lawlessness and chaos," at the Veterans Health Administration, including the payments of $6 billion a year in violation of federal contracting rules. The memo also says they "waste millions of dollars by paying excessive prices due to breaches of federal laws" and warns that "these unlawful acts may potentially result in serious harm or death to America's Veterans." Even the White House's own Deputy Chief of Staff described "significant and chronic systemic failures," in Veterans Affairs, including "a corrosive culture that has led to personnel problems across the Department," with "poor management," and "a history of retaliation toward employees raising issues." He said there is a "lack of accountability across all grade levels." Here are just a few examples: --Forty veterans died waiting for care in Phoenix. --Forty different VA facilities nationwide were found to be manipulating and falsifying wait times. --A VA employee who was involved in an armed robbery was kept on staff, as was a convicted sex offender. --The VA spent $8 million on solar panels for a facility knowing they would likely need to be torn down. --The St. Cloud, Minn. VA built a $2.3 million wind turbine in April 2011 that hasn't supplied power since 2012. Can you imagine the waste and corruption we'll find when we begin a full investigation in January of 2017? Most of those responsible have still not been held to account. Fixing this corruption will be one of my highest priorities  and it will happen. It will be fixed. That begins with a simple promise: every Veteran will get timely access to top-quality care Veterans should be guaranteed the right to choose their doctor and clinics, whether at a VA facility or at a private medical center. We must extend this right to all Veterans not just those who can't get an appointment in 30 days, or who live more than 40 miles from a VA hospital, which is the current policy. This promise includes guaranteed access to the best available healthcare services for our female Veterans. We must also do more to help our Veterans find jobs Every year, large corporations bring in many thousands of low-wage workers from overseas, and across the border, to fill jobs that could easily be filled by our Veterans. Veterans should come first in the country they fought to protect, and under a Trump Administration they will -- America First, Veterans First. Veterans' health care must also include the best mental health care. A shocking 20 Veterans are committing suicide each day, especially our older Veterans. This is a national tragedy. The evidence shows that if Veterans are in the system, receiving care, they are much less likely to take their own lives than Veterans outside the system. That is why we must increase the number of mental health care professionals inside the VA  while ensuring that Veterans can access private mental health care as well. America must take action to improve mental health services for the country at large. This includes expanding the number of facilities, integrating primary care and mental care professionals, reforming confinement rules, and making it easier for family members who see warning signs to get their loved ones the care they need  especially in emergencies. One of the most important reforms we can make is accountability Right now, when VA employees fail our Veterans, you can't discipline them. That's because of outdated civil service rules in need of reform. In fact, employees are given bonuses after making bad decisions. In 2014, the VA awarded $142 million in bonuses to its employees, including bonuses to the executives who oversaw construction of the Denver VA hospital that was more than $1 billion over budget. Two other VA executives even abused their authority to obtain $400,000 in relocation benefits. It doesn't have to be this way. As Veteran Affairs Chairman Jeff Miller said: "The VA is not sacred. The Veteran is." Here is my 10 step plan to ensure quality, timely care for every Veteran in America: One: I will appoint a Secretary of Veterans Affairs who will make it his or her personal mission to clean up the VA. The Secretary's sole mandate will be to serve our Veterans  not bureaucrats, not politicians, but Veterans. Amazingly, President Obama's VA Secretary recently downplayed concerns about waiting times by saying that people also wait in line at Disneyland. Two: I am going to use every lawful authority to remove and discipline federal employees or managers who fail our Veterans or breach the public trust. Three: I am going to ask Congress to pass legislation that ensures the Secretary of Veterans Affairs has the authority to remove or discipline any employee who risks the health, safety or well-being of any Veteran. Four: I am going to appoint a commission to investigate all the wrongdoing at the VA and then present those findings to Congress as the basis for bold legislative reform. Five: I am going to make sure the honest and dedicated people in the VA have their jobs protected, and are put in line for promotions. Six: I will create a private White House Hotline  that is answered by a real person 24 hours a day  to ensure that no valid complaint about VA wrongdoing falls through the cracks. I will instruct my staff that if a valid complaint is not addressed that the issue be brought directly to me, and I will pick up the phone and fix it myself, if need be. That's a promise. Seven: We are going to stop giving bonuses to people for wasting money, and start giving bonuses to people for improving service, saving lives and cutting waste. If an employee finds a smart way to save a large amount of money that also creates better outcomes for our Veterans, then a small, responsible portion of the money saved will be given as a one-time bonus and the rest will be returned to taxpayers. Eight: We are going to reform our visa programs to ensure American Veterans are in the front, not back, of the line. Nine: We are going to increase the number of mental health care professionals, and increase outreach to Veterans outside of the system. Ten: We are going to ensure every Veteran in America has the choice to seek care at the VA, or to seek private medical care paid for by our government. Never again will we allow a Veteran to suffer or die waiting for the care they so richly deserve. We need to clean out the corruption in Government, and Hillary Clinton will never be able to do it She is incompetent, and has proven that time and time again. Crooked Hillary Clinton is the Secretary of the Status Quo  and wherever Hillary Clinton goes, corruption and scandal follow. Our country needs change, and she will never give us change. The fact is, she helped create our rigged system. Hillary Clinton's America is a country where the elite get one standard of treatment and everybody else gets second-class treatment. The rigged system refused to prosecute her for conduct that put all of America at risk. Hillary Clinton went to great lengths to create a private email server and to bypass government security in order to keep her emails from being read by the public and by federal officials. In other words, she was willing to risk our foreign enemies reading her emails as long as the voting American public could not. Her conduct was willful, intentional, and unlawful  and her repeated false statements about her conduct prove that she was fully aware of her guilt. This was not just extreme carelessness with classified material  which is still totally disqualifying. This is calculated, deliberate, premeditated misconduct  followed by a cover-up that included false statements and lies to Congress, the media and the American people. In fact, when the FBI interviewed her for only 3 hours during the 4th of July weekend, her interview was not recorded, and she was, amazingly, not even put under oath. She carried out her dangerous email scheme at the same time as her bad judgement and enthusiasm for regime change was unleashing ISIS across the world. Afterwards, as a further demonstration of guilt, Hillary Clinton erased more than thirty thousand emails as part of the cover-up. The fact that she got away with all of this could be her single most impressive accomplishment. When thinking about her e-mail destruction, let's not forget: many foreign and corporate entities, and other special interests, with business before Hillary Clinton's State Department were making massive financial contributions. These contributions were made to both the Clinton Foundation and to the Clintons directly. If elected, Hillary Clinton would become the first President of the United States who wouldn't be able to pass a background check. Just look at what the FBI Director said about her  her misconduct is a disgrace and embarrassment to our country. Clearly, Hillary Clinton thinks she is above the law. Come November, the American people will show her that she is not. The decades of decay, division and decline will come to an end. The years of American Greatness will return. We are going to become, for the first time in a long time, one united country. We are going to make American Great Again  And Safe Again  For All Americans. We will dream big and bold and daring things once more. Let me conclude by paying tribute to every single American hero who has served this country, and most especially those who gave the ultimate sacrifice. Our debt to them is eternal and everlasting. We are going to fight for our military and our law enforcement personnel the same way they have fought for us. We will be a safe, strong, and proud country once again. Thank you.
t06.txt:Thank you, everybody. Great honor. Great honor, thank you. This is a wonderful day. Aww. [Chants of Trump, Trump, Trump] Wow.  On a Saturday morning yet. Isn't that nice? Thank you, all. And we're going to have an incredible convention. It's really going well. We're going to have an incredible convention. And we're going to get things solved, and we're going to do lots of wonderful things for our country, most importantly.  So I'm here today to introduce the man who will be my partner in this campaign, and the White House, to fix our rigged system -- we are in a rigged, rigged system -- and to make America safe again and to make America great again.  I want to also address the Islamic terror attack in France. We've witnessed horror beyond belief, no matter where you look. And now it's happening more and more. And it's never going to stop.  We need new leadership. We need new thinking. We need strength. We need in our country law and order. And if I'm elected president, that will happen. [applause]  I want to express our unyielding support for the people of France, and we mourn their loss as a nation.  And as far as Turkey is concerned, so many friends in Turkey, great people, amazing people. We wish them well. It looks like they're resolving the difficulty, but we wish them well. A lot of -- a lot of anguish last night, but hopefully it'll all work out.  Now, as, hopefully, the next president of the United States, I want to refer back to what's happened over the years. The Middle East today is more unstable than ever before. Never been like this. Out of control. After four years of Clinton, who really led the way and led Obama down a horrible path, because I don't even think he could have made these decisions so badly, she led him right down a horrible path. He didn't know what he was doing.  Iraq, Syria, all into chaos. And Iran is on a path to nuclear weapons. And on top of that, we gave them back $150 billion, and we didn't get our hostages until the end. Now we're seeing unrest in Turkey, a further demonstration of the failures of Obama-Clinton. You just have to look, every single thing they touched has turned to horrible, horrible, death-defying problems.  We also need to bring back in this country -- because we see what happened -- our industry, our manufacturing, our jobs. They've been taken away, like we're babies. Taken away. And we're going to bring them back.  I found the leader who will help us deliver a safe society and a prosperous -- really prosperous society for all Americans. Indiana Governor Mike Pence was my first choice. I've admired the work he's done, especially in the state of Indiana. And I'm going to go over some of those accomplishments in just a minute.  But I also admire the fact that he fights for the people, and he's going to fight for you. He is a solid, solid person. [applause]  Governor Pence served Indiana with distinction in Congress. He rose to leadership and served as the chairman of the entire House Republican Conference. Number one. He's really got the skills of a highly talented executive, leading the state of Indiana to jobs, growth, and opportunity, in spite of the relentless obstacles put in his way and every state's way by the Obama administration. It's horrible out there. High taxes and regulations. And it's out of control.  Mike Pence is a man of honor, character, and honesty. We know that. Hillary Clinton is the embodiment of corruption. She's a corrupt person. What she's done with her e-mails, what she's done with so many things, and I see the ads up all the time, the ads. She's totally bought and paid for by Wall Street, the special interests, the lobbyists, 100 percent. She's crooked Hillary. [applause]  And I think that, while she got away with murder, in fact, I think it might be her greatest accomplishment, escaping the recent scandal, and her lies, and the loss of 33,000 e-mails -- but it wasn't a loss, she discarded -- that in itself is a major crime. Other people have been paying tremendous prices for what they've done, which is peanuts compared to what happened with Hillary Clinton.  Thirty-three thousand e-mails are missing, and that's OK? Didn't give them to the FBI? Didn't give them to the attorney general, and that's OK? Wipes her server clean, that's OK? These are crimes. These are crimes. And how she got away with it, I think I understand it, but I think a lot of people don't.  But I do believe, while she didn't pay the price she should have paid, she's going to pay that price when November 8th rolls around. She's going to pay it at the polls. I believe that. [applause]  On top of everything else, Hillary made $21.6 million giving speeches to special interests in a short period of time. She's totally owned by Wall Street. We believe in Americanism; she believes in globalism. And it's not that she believes in it. The people that give her all of this money believe in it. And she'll believe in whatever they want her to believe. Believe me. That's it. [applause]  What a difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and Mike Pence. [applause]  Mike Pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy: Radical Islam. Radical Islamic terrorism. You saw it the other day with the truck screaming out the window. You heard what he was screaming out the window. You saw it in San Bernardino. You saw it at the World Trade Center. You saw it in Orlando. How horrible was that? You saw it in Paris. You see it all over.  And Hillary is a weak person. We are the law and order candidates, and we're the law and order party. We're going to change things around. There's going to be respect again for law and order. [applause]  Hillary Clinton's foreign policy helped launch ISIS. You know, she's talking -- I see the ads she puts on. If I make one statement, which is fine, she'll take that statement and put on a totally dishonest ad, because she's got a lot of money because it's given to her by the lobbyists and by the special interests. Got a lot of money.  But I see the ads on foreign policy. She's talking about Donald Trump doesn't have foreign policy experience. Of course not. I've been a very, very, very successful businessperson. I mean -- but -- but if you look at my calls, I said, don't go into Iraq. Nobody cared, because I was a businessperson. I was a civilian. Take the oil. Many, many calls I've made.  You take a look. I said that in Scotland and in the U.K., that was going to happen. I was the one that predicted it. And everybody said, he's wrong, he's wrong. President Obama said, if it happens, they're going to get to the back of the line, which probably is one of the reasons they lost, because I consider it a win. I think it was a win for them, actually, because they don't want to be told what to do. And they don't want to be told that when people pour into the country, they have to take them even if they're not qualified, even if they don't have paperwork, even if they have no idea where they come from.  And I said that Brexit's going to happen. I said that they are going to break away. And everybody laughed at me. And the odds were 20 percent. And then when it happened, she took an ad saying, oh, Donald Trump said this or that, but I'm the one that said it was going to happen. And some of the more fair reporters -- about 30 percent of them -- said he was right. I appreciate that. Seventy percent didn't, so that's OK.  So Mike Pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy. So important. Now, I think if you look at one of the big reasons that I chose Mike -- and one of the reasons is party unity, I have to be honest. So many people have said party unity. Because I'm an outsider. I want to be an outsider. I think it's one of the reasons I won in landslides. I won in landslides. This wasn't close. This wasn't close. [applause]  No, this wasn't close. This was -- in the history of the Republican Party, history, with 17 people running, you have to understand, other people ran against one, two, and three. There were 17. We got -- I say we, because I'm the messenger, I'm a messenger -- I'm doing a good job, but I'm a messenger -- we got almost 14 million votes. That's more than any other person in the history of the Republican Party in the primary system running for president.  Think of it. That's more than Ronald Reagan, who we love. That's more than Richard Nixon. It's more than Dwight D. Eisenhower. You know, he won the Second World War, in all fairness. Pretty good. It's more than the Bushes.  But I mean by a lot. I don't mean by a little. But that's with 17 people. People don't over-say that. That means our message is unbelievable. And I want to thank all of the loyal people -- because I have such loyal, unbelievable people, and they displayed that just yesterday in Cleveland, where it's going to be so amazing.  But they displayed it. It was on display, where we had this group of people, who -- many of whom I've known, and I won't say, because for party unity, I'll say they're wonderful people, OK? Never Trump, they said, never Trump, never Trump. Oh, we're going to win. They got crushed. And they got crushed immediately, because people want what we're saying to happen.  They're tired of a country that has horrible trade deals, that has no borders, that has taxes that are through the roof, highest taxed nation just about in the world, that has regulations that don't allow you to start a business and destroy your business if you do start -- and, by the way, speaking of destroying businesses, we're going to take care of the miners and we're going to take care of the steelworkers. We're going to put 'em back to work. [applause]  So they're very tired of it. But I want to thank all of those people that  delegates-- that were on the different committees, because, boy, was that something. Did we show them something. And unfortunately, the vote was very late. But essentially, we had 112-12. This was the vote that was going to put it onto the floor and we're going to have a big fight. We're not going to have a fight. People agree with what we've -- they want the wall. They want the borders. They want these things to happen.  And what we're doing... [applause]  And what we're doing that I'm so proud of, so proud -- and nobody else would even think about doing it -- I fought very hard for it. We'll call it the Johnson amendment, where he took away from the evangelicals -- and I want to thank the evangelicals, because without the evangelicals, I could not have won this nomination. The evangelicals have been unbelievable. I dominated with the evangelicals. A lot of people were surprised. They say he's not perfect. But you know what? They know I'm going to get the job done, and they're really smart. [applause]  And I said -- and I said for the evangelicals, that we're going to do something that nobody's even tried to do. You have the Johnson amendment passed by Lyndon Johnson and his group. And he was a powerful president. He knew how to get things done. He got bogged down in a war that was a disaster and it destroyed him. But he was a powerful president.  And we call it the Johnson amendment, where you are just absolutely shunned if you're evangelical, if you want to talk religion, you lose your tax-exempt status. We put into the platform, we're going to get rid of that horrible Johnson amendment. And we're going to let evangelicals, we're going to let Christians and Jews and people of religion talk without being afraid to talk.  I saw this. I had so many great leaders so many times up to my office, the top -- the absolute top evangelical leaders, Christian leaders, Jewish leaders, believe it or not, some Muslim leaders -- people are going to be surprised to hear that -- I had the top leaders up to my office, and I said, why is it that you're so powerful as an individual, and yet when you get out there, you're sort of timid?  And they didn't know how to answer the question. And it took two, three meetings before I figured it out. One great, great gentleman that everybody knows, but whose name I will not reveal, said, Mr. Trump, we live in fear in our churches and our synagogues. We live in fear that we're going to lose our tax-exempt status if we say anything that's even slightly political.  And I looked out the window. I was in Trump Tower, and I pointed to people walking down the street. I said, well, they have the right to speak, but you don't. That means they're more powerful than you are. We have to do something about it. How did it start? How did it start? [applause]  And they said, it started because of Lyndon Johnson. And he actually had a problem in Texas with a certain religious leader. And he did this, and he got it done. And we're going to undo it, so that religious leaders in this country, and those unbelievable people--and not because they backed me in such large numbers-- but so that religion can again have a voice, because religion's voice has been taken away. And we're going to change that. OK? All right. [applause]  Back to Mike Pence. So one of the primary reasons I chose Mike was I looked at Indiana, and I won Indiana big. Remember, Indiana was going to be the firewall. That's where Trump was going down -- they agreed I'd win New York, I'd win Pennsylvania, I'd win all these places. But Indiana was going to be the firewall.  So I got to study Indiana, and I got to study New York and a lot of other places, and I saw how NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton, has drained our manufacturing jobs, just drained us like we've never been drained before. NAFTA, again, signed by Bill Clinton. NAFTA is the worst economic deal in the history of our country. Manufacturing down in some states 55, 60 percent. It's a horror show, moving to Mexico, moving to other places.  I have a friend who's a great builder. What he builds is plants. That's all he does, is build plants. He doesn't build buildings. He doesn't -- he builds plants. It's the biggest in the world, from what I hear.  I said, how's business? I was with him the other day. How's business? He goes unbelievable. I said, really, wow, I'm surprised. Why is it unbelievable? Because I think of him as building in this country. He says, Donald, what we're doing in Mexico, you won't believe. I said, what do you mean? He said, we're building plants in Mexico the likes of which we've never seen.  I said, what about this country? Not much. Not much. That's the expression. He said exactly that. Not much. I said, but Mexico? He said, you've never seen anything like it. It's incredible.  Folks, that's going to stop. We're going to go reverse it. We're going to bring our jobs back to this country. We can't be the stupid people anymore. OK? [applause]  And he was better than a pollster. He's better than a consultant. I would say, how are we doing? And you get a big report that costs you millions of dollars. Doesn't cost me millions. Me, I give them $10,000, OK? [laughter]  It costs other people millions. It costs other campaigns millions to get a report. Every time they get a report, it's millions. But I'll tell you what, a guy like this is better than anybody you can hire to do a report. And he said it. He didn't say it from the standpoint of he's upset about it. Just fact. How are we doing? Unbelievable in Mexico. In fact, he actually said, I've never, ever seen anything like it.  And if you look, Ford is building massive plants there instead of Michigan. We want them to build them in Michigan. They're going to build them in Michigan. And you know that I know how to do that. So easy. So easy.  But they're not going to do and they're not going to take advantage of us without retribution. There are consequences when you fire thousands of people and move to another country and then think you're going to you're your product and sell it in here. There are consequences. And those consequences are going to keep companies in our country. It's very simple. And everybody here knows what the consequences are, but I won't say that because I'm much more interested right now in Mike. [laughter]  Indiana's unemployment rate -- and this is the primary reason I wanted Mike, other than he looks very good, other than he's got an incredible family, incredible wife and family -- Karen is amazing. [applause]  Incredible family. Highly respected. Expected to go for another four years. He would have won, I think, very easily in Indiana. Indiana, their unemployment rate has fallen. When he was there, when he started, 8.4 percent when he was governor, when he took over, to less than 5 percent in May of 2016. Since January 2013, Indiana's labor force has increased by more than 186,000 jobs. You have to understand, I've gone around to all these states. I've gone to all of them. And every time, I have statisticians. I say give me the stats on a state.  And it's always bad, down, down, down. Down 40 percent, 50 percent, 60 percent in some cases. Here's somebody where it's gone up. Private sector job growth is up by more than 147,000 jobs since 2013. That's like very unusual.  Governor Pence balanced the budget. Can you imagine a balanced budget? Our budget's so out of whack in this country, we don't know what we're doing. We're going to owe very soon $21 trillion. He balanced the budget. They don't know what that means. Governor Pence balanced the budget, produced a surplus, and maintains a $2 billion reserve fund in the state of Indiana.  It's also rated triple-A, their bonds are rated triple-A. Very few states have that. Triple-A. The best. That's as good as you can get, whether you're a company, a state, triple-A.  Indiana was recently recognized by Chief Executive Magazine as the number-one state in the Midwest for business. Number one. And it's not even close. There are approximately 34,000 fewer Hoosiers on unemployment insurance now than there were when Mike Pence took office. So you have fewer Hoosiers, fewer people from Indiana.  And besides that, Bobby Knight, my friend, who really did help me. I mean, if you want a reference, Bobby Knight in Indiana, we love Bobby Knight. But he agrees with everything I'm saying. He loves the governor.  Indiana has the second-lowest unemployment rate in the nation, for veterans, where nobody's fighting for the veterans like I'm fighting for the veterans, the veterans have been left behind. [applause]  If you remember a few months ago, Hillary Clinton said the, really -- they're doing much better, the V.A. is much better. They're doing a much better job than people give it credit for. People are dying on line waiting for five, six days for doctors. People are dying on -- they can't even see a doctor. It's a scandal.  Take a look at what's happening with the V.A. in Arizona. Take a look at what's happening with -- you know, just the Veterans Administration hospitals. It's a scandal. It's corrupt. It's incompetent. It's a scandal. And Hillary Clinton thought it was just fine. And, boy, am I going to win big with the veterans. I mean, we know that for a fact. [applause]  So it's now 2.4 percent for veterans. In 2013, when Mike Pence took office, the rate for veterans was 6.7 percent. It was 31st in the nation, one of the bad ones, and now it's almost the best. Got 'em jobs. Got 'em jobs.  Indianapolis is ranked second in top 10 metro areas for young college graduates. That's a great thing. They're going to stay there. That's a great thing. And Mike worked hard on that. He was telling me, that was not easy.  Under Governor Pence's leadership, Indiana enacted the largest K-12 education funding increase in the state's history. So you're balancing budgets, and yet you're giving more money to education. Isn't that a great thing? [applause]  Indiana has just about the largest school choice program in America. School choice is where it's at, folks. You want to get your schools better, you gotta get rid of Common Core fast.  Governor Pence enacted the largest income tax cut in the state's history. Think of that. We're cutting taxes and balancing budgets. And along with corporate tax reform, just about number one in the country. CNBC ranked Indiana first in the nation for its infrastructure.  So with all of these cuts and all of these balancing budgets, we're spending more money on education, and the infrastructure is kept up. That had so much -- look, as a builder, nobody in the history of this country has ever known so much about infrastructure as Donald Trump. I build infrastructure. Do I know how to build a wall? Do I know how to build infrastructure?  You know, it's very interesting. We're building -- we're building -- I won -- the -- which is pretty amazing with the Obama administration, but I won the right to have the old post office building on Pennsylvania Avenue, right near the White House, and it's an amazing -- probably the best location, one of the most sought after projects in the history of the GSA, General Services. And I really like what's happened. We're going to have an opening very soon. Ivanka and Eric and Don did a fantastic job on it.  But I thought the other day, I was going over the numbers, we're under budget and about a year -- actually more than a year  but we're a year ahead of schedule, and we're under budget substantially. And the quality of the work is even better than we originally were going to do. [applause]  And when I explained to a government representative that we're under budget and ahead of schedule, they almost fell off, because they've never heard those words before. They've never heard them.  So when I see what happened to Indiana, which was having tremendous problems, when I see what happened to Indiana under Mike's work -- also his predecessor did a great job, by the way, great job, who's now at Duke -- who's now at Purdue -- when I see what happened with respect to the numbers, the state, and everything else, that, to me, was probably the single most important point, because it's something that hasn't happened -- almost has not happened in this whole country.  The turnaround and the strength of Indiana has been incredible, and I learned that when I campaigned there. And I learned that when I won that state in a landslide. And I learned that when Governor Pence, under tremendous pressure from establishment people, endorsed somebody else, but it was more of an endorsement for me, if you remember. He talked about Trump, then he talked about Ted -- who's a good guy, by the way, who's going to be speaking at the convention, Ted Cruz, good guy -- but he talked about Trump, Ted, then he went back to Trump. I said, who did he endorse?  So even though he was under pressure, because I'm so, you know, outside of the establishment, it was the single greatest non-endorsement I've ever had in my life, OK? I will tell you. [applause]  So with that, I would like to introduce a man who I truly believe will be outstanding in every way and will be the next vice president of the United States, Governor Mike Pence. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. [applause]
t08.txt:Donald Trump. So, it's been 235 days since crooked Hillary Clinton has had a press conference. And you, as reporters who give her all of these glowing reports, should ask yourselves why. And I'll tell you why. Because despite the nice platitudes, she's been a mess. You look at what's happened with ISIS, which isn't even mentioned. You look at what's happening with law and order, they don't even mention our police. They mention everybody but our police. They don't have an American flag on the dais until we started complaining and then they ran up with two very small little flags, one that we saw. So you know, I put myself through your news conferences often, not that its fun. 235 days, no news conference for Hillary Clinton. You oughta check it out because there's a lot going on. Her great disloyalty to the person that rigged the system for her, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, she totally rigged it. Bernie Sanders never had a chance. And total disloyalty, it's like you're fired, get out, fast. The e-mail situation I call it the double e-mail situation, both very serious. What was said in the last ones to the DNC was horrible, absolutely horrible. If I would've used language like they used about religion, about race, about everything else that they discuss in those e-mails I would've had to run and hide and probably drop out of the race. With her, everything's just fine. So just ask yourself why she doesn't have news conferences. And honestly, the reason is because there's no way she can answer questions because the job she has done is so bad. When they talk about change, I noticed they have change. She's been there for 30 years. Thirty years. There's no change. It's going to be the same, it's going to be an extension of Obama. In my opinion, worse. She lied about TPP. She was for TPP, she saw me on television knocking the hell out of it because it's a horror show, it's going to kill all our jobs, it's going to be almost as bad as NAFTA, maybe worse which her husband signed, by the way, which destroyed this country, destroyed manufacturing in the United States. And I'll do something about it, that'll be so renegotiated. And by the way, yesterday for the first time she said she wants to renegotiate trade agreements. First time, yesterday. Well, because of me. She also saw me talking about TPP and currency manipulation and currency devaluation. And she heard it and she said wow, she can't win that subject in a debate. So all of a sudden she goes and she goes against TPP, her vice president is one of the biggest proponents of TPP and now he's going against it. And Bernie Sanders was right, he was against it. They will go for TPP and vote it in very shortly after the election if she wins, which for the sake of our country we all hope and I hope that she doesn't. They will vote it in—just mark my words, hopefully we don't have to worry about it—but she will vote. She'll change a comma, she'll change a paragraph of the 6,000 page document that nobody's even read on our side. Just so you understand, the other countries know every word, every paragraph, every sentence, every single comma and period. We don't even read it, our country. Because we're led by stupid people. so she saw me talking about TPP, she realized that she couldn't defend it, her special interests are pushing her hard because she's bought and sold by the special interests. They're pushing her very hard and so she said she's against it. The day she gets in—which hopefully will never happen—she will approve or shortly thereafter TPP. And that will be another disaster for job in our country, OK? So why don't we start off any questions? Yes, sir? Question. [off-mike] Donald Trump. It's just a total deflection, this whole thing with Russia. In fact, I saw her campaign manager I don't know his title, Mook. I saw him on television and they asked him about Russia and the hacking. By the way, they hacked—they probably have her 33,000 e-mails. I hope they do. They probably have her 33,000 e-mails that she lost and deleted because you'd see some beauties there. So let's see. But I watched this guy Mook and he talked about we think it was Russia that hacked. Now, first of all was what was said on those that's so bad but he said I watched it. I think he was live. But he said we think it was Russia that hacked. And then he said—and this is in person sitting and watching television as I've been doing—and then he said could be Trump, yeah, yeah. Trump, Trump, oh yeah, Trump. He reminded me of John Lovitz for "Saturday Night Live" in the liar where he'd go yes, yes, I went to Harvard, Harvard, yes, yes. This is the guy, you have to see it. Yes, it could be Trump, yes, yes. So it is so farfetched. It's so ridiculous. Honestly I wish I had that power. I'd love to have that power but Russia has no respect for our country. And that's why—if it is Russia, nobody even knows this, it's probably China, or it could be somebody sitting in his bed. But it shows how weak we are, it shows how disrespected we are. Total—assuming it's Russia or China or one of the major countries and competitors, it's a total sign of disrespect for our country. Putin and the leaders throughout the world have no respect for our country anymore and they certainly have no respect for our leader. So I know nothing about it. It's one of the most farfetched I've ever heard. Yes, Jon? Question. [off-mike] Donald Trump. I never met Putin, I don't know who Putin is. He said one nice thing about me. He said I'm a genius. I said thank you very much to the newspaper and that was the end of it. I never met Putin. Question. [off-mike] Donald Trump. I would treat Vladimir Putin firmly but there's nothing that I can think of that I'd rather do than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way they are right now so that we can go and knock out ISIS together with other people and with other countries. Wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along with people, wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along, as an example, with Russia? I'm all for it and let's go get ISIS because we have to get ISIS and we have to get them fast. You saw what happened with the priest, it's only going to get worse. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow 550 percent more people from that region into our country and we have no idea who they are, where they come from, where their documentation is, it's only going to get worse and it's going to start getting bad in our country. We're letting people come in by the tens of thousands. You see what happened to the French priest. A friend of mine, he said he was going to France, like three, four months ago. I saw him yesterday. I said how'd you like France. He said I wouldn't go to France. I wouldn't go to France. Because France is no longer France. France is no longer France. They won't like me for saying that but you see what happened in Nice, you see what happened yesterday with the priest who was supposed to be a spectacular man. France is no longer France and this world better be very careful and they better get very tough and very smart and they'll never do it with Hillary Clinton. And by the way, in terms of change, she's been there for 30 years. She's been doing this for 30 years. What she's going to go all of sudden things are going to change? She's bought and sold 100 percent by special interests and lobbyists. Yes, Tom? Question. [off-mike] Donald Trump. None, none. Question. [off-mike] Donald Trump. Because it's under order. And I'll release them when the audits completed. Nobody would release when it's under—I've had audits for 15 or 16 years. Every year I have a routine audit. I'm under audit, when the audits complete I'll release them. But zero, I mean I will tell you right now, zero, I have nothing to do with Russia, yes? Question. [off-mike] Donald Trump. I don't know, I don't know. It depends on the audit. It depends on the audit, not a big deal. By the way, just so you understand, I've released my papers, 104 pages of documents. I built an unbelievable company, tremendous cash, tremendous company with some of the great assets of the world. You've seen it. You were all very disappointed when you saw it actually but that's OK. Far, far great than anybody ever thought. I have a great company. I built an unbelievable company but if you look there you'll see there's nothing in Russia. And as far as the tax returns, as soon as the audits complete, like any lawyer would tell you, Greta Van Susteren she was going over it a while ago, she's a lawyer. She said well no lawyer would let somebody release a tax return when they're under audit. It's a routine audit. I've gone through audits, which I think is very unfair, for 15 years. I have friends that are very rich and never get audited. I'm audited every year. Maybe that's because of politics, who knows. Question. [off-mike] Donald Trump. I'm not going to tell Putin what to do. Why should I tell Putin what to do? He already did something today where he said don't blame them, essentially, for your incompetence. Let me tell you, it's not even about Russia or China or whoever it is that's doing the hacking. It was about the things that were said in those e-mails. They were terrible things, talking about Jewish, talking about race, talking about atheist, trying to pin labels on people—what was said was a disgrace, and it was Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and believe me, as sure as you're sitting there, Hillary Clinton knew about it. She knew everything. Debbie Wasserman Schultz could not breathe without speaking and getting approval from Hillary Clinton. Couldn't breathe. And you saw that. It also showed that it was a fixed race, but I've been saying that long before I saw the e-mails. It was a rigged race. It was totally rigged. And Debbie Wasserman Schultz rigged it for Hillary Clinton, and the sad part is, Bernie Sanders has, to use an old word that I use on occasion, he's lost his energy. He wants to go home and go to sleep. But he's got a lot of people that walked out last night. Now, hundreds of people walked out of the Democrat Convention last night. I didn't even hear about it. Nobody showed it. I didn't see it on television. You people don't talk about it. The Republican Convention was incredible. I hear I had one of the biggest bounces in decades. Like, some people are saying nine points. In fact, a poll just came out ten minutes ago, "Los Angeles Times", Trump 47, Clinton 40. And the reason is that people are sick and tired of Hillary Clinton. Question. [inaudible] Putin say stay out? Why not say that? Donald Trump. Why do I have to get involved with Putin? I have nothing to do with Putin. I've never spoken to him. I don't know anything about him other than he will respect me. He doesn't respect our president. And if it is Russia—which it's probably not, nobody knows who it is—but if it is Russia, it's really bad for a different reason, because it shows how little respect they have for our country, when they would hack into a major party and get everything. But it would be interesting to see—I will tell you this—Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 e-mails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let's see if that happens. That'll be next. Yes, sir... Question. [inaudible] this audience and make our campaign—what exactly do you believe should happen to minimum wage in this country [inaudible]? OK. Sure. Two big questions. The minimum wage has to go up. People are—at least $10, but it has to go up. But I think that states—federal—I think that states should really call the shot. As an example, I live in New York. It's very expensive in New York. You can't buy a hot dog for the money you're talking about. You go to other states and it's not expensive at all. Now what it does is puts New York at a disadvantage if the minimum wage is up, companies move out and things, bad things happen. At the same time, people have to be taken care of. But what I'm really going to do on the minimum wage—but it has to go up. Now, Bernie Sanders lied. Bernie Sanders said in his speech the other day that Donald Trump wants the minimum wage to go below $7. I said, where did he come up with that one? That one is just like Joe Biden lied today. He said that Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb—he was on television—he said, Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb the enemy in the Middle East. Now, that was Ted Cruz that said that. That was not Donald Trump. I mean, he's not a very bright guy, but that was Ted Cruz that said it. And he said it with such surety—Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb—I never said I wanted to carpet bomb. That was Ted Cruz. You remember Ted Cruz said it? You will confirm that, I think. Go ahead. So I would like to raise it to at least $10, and what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring jobs back to this country so that people can start working again so that the $10 and the $15 and the numbers you're talking about are going to—literally, they're going to be peanuts compared to what people can make in the country, because I'm going to bring jobs back from Mexico, which is booming, booming. I have a friend who builds plants and he's a great builder of plants and I was with him the other day—great guy. He builds massive plants, for automobiles, for computers, for anything. That's what he does. I think he's the biggest, but certainly one of the biggest. And I said, how's it going? He said, unbelievable. Oh good, that's good news. The country's doing well. No, the country's not doing well, but Mexico is unbelievable. The plants I'm building in Mexico, I've never seen anything—it's the eighth wonder of the world. And he's not happy. He's an American guy. He'd rather build them here. But he said it's unbelievable. That's what's happened to our country. Because we have leadership that doesn't know what they're doing. Question. [inaudible] special extreme vetting? Donald Trump. Yes we're going to be listing; yeah we're going to be giving a list of those territories. And if you come from those territories we have extreme vetting. And we're going to have extreme vetting anyway. Look we have people coming into this country who have very evil intentions. And we have people whether in San Bernardino or whether it's the World Trade Center or whether it's a lot of other things, and you look all over the world and you see what's happening. You look at Orlando, how bad was that? And that was horrible. That was going after the gay community it looks like. We can't let this happen. We cannot let this happen. We cannot let people come in. Now Hillary Clinton likes to up it. Her running mate Tim Kaine, who by the way did a terrible job in New Jersey. First act he did in New Jersey was ask for a $4 billion tax increase and he's not very popular in New Jersey. And he still isn't. What? I mean Virginia. The first thing he did, the first thing that Tim Kaine did, he asked for a $4 billion tax increase. And he's not very popular. So let me just tell you, and I went all over Virginia and I was there the other day. And I thought he'd be popular. He's not popular because he asked for tax increases. Big tax increases in Virginia. Big. And also the unemployment went up, I think it doubled or close to doubled during his tenure. But what he wanted to do is very strongly and he's on record, he wanted to have even more of the people from that region of the world come in than Hillary Clinton wants. And it's unacceptable. OK. Yes? [inaudible] Question. Shortly ago prosecutors in Baltimore announced they were dropping all the charges... Donald Trump. I saw that. Question. Against police involved in the Freddie Gray case. Donald Trump. Right. Question. Your reaction [inaudible]? Donald Trump. I do have a reaction to the prosecutor in Baltimore who indicted those police officers, I do. I think she ought to prosecute herself OK? That's my reaction. I think it was disgraceful what she did and the way she did it. And the news conference that she had where they were guilty before anybody even knew the facts. And I give a lot of respect and a lot of credit to those police officers who probably could have made a deal. I give a lot of respect, a lot of credit that they stuck it out. And you had victory after victory after victory. And she had no chance, don't forget she prosecuted the best case, what she thought was her best cases first. She should prosecute herself. She should be held accountable. Question. [inaudible] to Americans who feel like this was kind of a railroad case. Freddie Gray is now a cause celebre. Donald Trump. Well, that was a bad case to prove it. That was a bad case. I mean if you're going to do that, it's OK because you have to, you know, there are times when police officers behave very badly. But you have to get the right time. This was not one of those times. And I think that she is a disgrace to the world of prosecutors for what she did. Yes ma'am? Question. So as you've gotten to know Governor Pence what surprises you most about him... Donald Trump. Yeah. Question. And [inaudible]... Donald Trump. I have a great relationship with Governor Pence. We spent the last three days together. He was absolutely my first choice and I never wavered despite the press. The press was saying, and it was interesting, I spoke to him at 11:05, him and his wife, and I told him that I was going to be choosing them if I'd be lucky enough for him to accept. And he accepted. And that was it. For me that was it. But right around that time you had the attack in Nice. And I was going to have a news conference either the following morning or the next day. And of course I had to delay the news conference because there was attack, a horrible attack, horrible. In France. And I delayed the news conference and everyone said, oh he's having second thoughts. I never had a second thought in my life. It was such a lie. I mean so many lies in the press. But it was such a lie. And he has been so great. Honestly he's been even better than I thought OK? Better. Question. Do you think the Geneva Convention are out of date? Donald Trump. I think everything's is out of date. We have a whole new world. When I said that NATO, to Wolf Blitzer, is obsolete, I got attacked. Three days later people that study NATO said you know Trump is right. You know what? We have a lot of things that are out date because they're 20 and 30 and 40 years old. NATO, you know this isn't a country from 40 years ago. Today we have a different threat. We have a terror threat. And we have an ISIS threat. And by the way, ISIS isn't even mentioned. It's not even mentioned during the Democratic Convention. And everyone's talking about it. The reason they can't mention it is because they grew it. Go ahead. Question. What would you renegotiate: the enhanced interrogation aspect of it? The... Donald Trump. I would—Katy, I would renegotiate so much of everything. I'm going to renegotiate our trade deals where we're losing with everybody, Katy. I'm going to renegotiate our military deals where we're protecting countries and they're not living up to the bargain. They're not living up to the bargain. And everyone agrees with me, except for the media. And the media never says that. I like NATO, just so you understand. I like NATO. I like the concept of NATO. It is somewhat outdated because it doesn't cover terror the way it should. I've been saying this for six months now. A couple of months ago, front page, Wall Street Journal, "We are going to cover terror," they announced somebody. I think NATO's great. But it's got to be modernized. And—and countries that we're protecting have to pay what they're supposed to be paying. Question. On the Geneva Convention [inaudible]. Donald Trump. Yes? Question. Do you think that they should allow for that, given the [inaudible]? Donald Trump. I am a person that believes in enhanced interrogation, yes. And by the way, it works. Question. [inaudible] will you defend the Baltic states if they're invaded by Russia? According to... Donald Trump. I'll tell you what. Let me say it once again. Let me say it once again. OK? Many countries, including the NATO countries, some of which I think you have five that are current that have paid what they owe. And they can afford to pay this. It's not like they can't afford it. They just see us as a soft touch. You know, in business we say somebody's a soft touch. I don't know if I've been called a soft touch, but maybe I have sometimes. But in business, they call them a soft touch. They haven't paid us. OK? I want them to pay. Excuse me. I'm not saying anything. I don't talk. I'm not like Obama where he tells you everything he's going to do—we're going to go and do this; we're going to go and do that. I don't talk. But they're going to pay. No, no—yeah, it sends a signal. You know what signal it says? It says we're going to pay. You know, somebody said, "but we have treaties." I said that's right. And in the treaties, they're supposed to pay. They're going to pay. And they will pay. They will pay. [crosstalk] Donald Trump. Yes? Question. [inaudible] how are you planning to [inaudible]? Donald Trump. We're going to have a whole policy on that over the next three weeks. I'm going to be doing a big thing on that. [crosstalk] Donald Trump. Well, I've been doing very well with the Hispanic community. I mean, really well. I mean, the—the poll numbers are going up very high. I think we had one recently 35 or 36. But I'm going to have a whole—we're going to have a news conference on that over the next three weeks. So, and I want to just tell you because these polls cover it, so L.A. Times, 47-40; CNN, way up. They're all way up. Biggest—they say the biggest bounce in memory. Because today I heard a dishonest guy on television say, "Well, Trump didn't get much of a bounce." So, you know, I have to at least say. Jeremy, go ahead. Question. [inaudible] do you believe that Vladimir Putin would rather deal with President Trump or President Clinton? Donald Trump. I don't think he respects Clinton. I don't think Putin has any respect whatsoever for Clinton. I think he does respect me. And I hope I get along great with him. It's possible that we won't, Jeremy. I hope that we get along great with Putin because it would be great to have Russia with a good relationship. Right now, we don't have a good relationship. Putin has said things over the last year that are really bad things. OK? He mentioned the "N" word one time. I was shocked to hear him mention the "N" word. You know what the "N" word is, right? He mentioned it. I was shocked. He has a total lack of respect for President Obama. Number one, he doesn't like him. And number two, he doesn't respect him. I think he's going to respect your president if I'm elected. And I hope he likes me. Yes? Yes, sir? Question. [inaudible] relations? Donald Trump. Yes, sir. [crosstalk] Donald Trump. But let me finish with Jeremy. Go ahead. Question. Would a President Trump be better for U.S.-Russia relations than [inaudible]? Donald Trump. President Trump would be so much better for U.S.-Russian relations. You can't be worse. Hey look, when I was a young men studying history and studying all of these things that I've always found fascinating, one thing that I've always heard is you never want to do anything to unite Russia and China. Well, they're united now, in a true sense. They've never been closer. They're selling oil to China. We forced them into this position. [crosstalk] Donald Trump. No, wait a minute. [crosstalk] Donald Trump. No, I'm not going to be an adversary. No, not at all. I have tenants from China. I have the biggest bank in the world from China paying me rent. I mean, I have great relationships with China. I'm not blaming China for getting away with murder. I'm blaming our leadership is incompetent. We don't know what we're doing. I don't blame—I respect China. Hey, if China can get away with trade deficits every year of hundreds of billions of dollars—if they can get away with that, my hat's off to them. I have no problem with China. I have a problem with our incompetent leadership allowing that to happen. And I believe that Hillary Clinton is even more bought and paid for than Barack Obama. I think it will get worse. It's going to be four more years of Obama which is unacceptable to a lot of people, you see that. But I believe that Hillary Clinton will be worse, than Obama. Yes? Question. [off-mike] you mentioned that you wanted to make college education more affordable. Donald Trump. That's right. Question. Working on a plan... Donald Trump. That's right, I'm going to be doing something over the next four weeks, very much so. Question. Are you prepared to give us any sort of... Donald Trump. No, I'm prepared to say we're gonna have a great plan. One of the things I think because I've traveled all over the country and I'm going—you know where I'm going, I guess you all know, I don't have to say. But I'm going to Toledo and I'm going to different places today and I've met so many people. This is such a great country, these are such great people. one of the saddest things I see are college students that work so hard, that go to colleges, good colleges, they're good students, they do a great job. Number one, they get out, they have no jobs. Because our jobs are going to Mexico, they're going to China, they're going to Japan, they're going all over the place. They're not coming here. Just like my friend who builds the plants but he doesn't build them here, much. And the saddest thing I see is these students are leveraged debt up to their—up to their neck. They can't breathe, they're scared, they're so scared they have leveraged their entire life. They have loans. And I have to tell you, the colleges are viewing the students as just a con to it. Because the students get government money, passes through but the number gets higher and higher. Because college costs are out of control, because the colleges say what difference does it make? If you take a look at the salaries being paid, you take a look at what's going on with the colleges. Because all of this is a pass through and the students are a con to it. So the colleges are costing so much money. We are going to help the students. Maybe that doesn't fit beautifully within the Republican framework. But I told this during various times to lots of different people and nobody has a problem with it. We have to help our students. Our students are under tremendous pressure to a point where it's making them sick. Our students are under tremendous pressure, we have to help our students. And I'm going to have a plan over the next four weeks. [crosstalk] Question. [off-mike] talking about possibly... Donald Trump. Everything's on the table, you'll see. Everything—it's a very important—it's a very important subject. Yes, ma'am? Question. Mr. Trump, [off-mike]. Donald Trump. I think my message is resonating because they have confidence on me at the border, if they don't want people pouring into our country. Likewise, they have confidence with me on ISIS, not only in terms of getting rid of them but also in terms of keeping them out of our country because I will not have people come into our country who want to do damage to our people. I think they have a lot of confidence in terms of my bringing back jobs because I see Carrier and I see Ford and I see all of these companies leaving and going to Mexico like there's nothing to it. And then they make their product, they sell it back to the United States, no tax, no nothing, we get nothing except unemployment. And I think people see that. I can tell you I mean I'm like a pollster myself when I'm in front of these massive audiences, one of the things that gets constantly—you people know because you're there—the biggest applause is a repeal and replacement of Obamacare. Because Obamacare is a disaster. In Texas, going through BlueCross/BlueShield they just announced a 60 percent increase. On November 1st, you're going to have new numbers come out for Obamacare, having to do with increases. President Obama is trying to get it moved to December. Because it is election-defying. It is going to be a massive number, the biggest number ever in our country's history for health care. It's going to be announced on November 1st. I just asked the press, don't let him do that. Obamacare is a disaster, people are dying with it. It's a disaster and everybody knows and it's going to fold, anyway. In '17 unfortunately—if I'm president—I mean I've got to take over this mess. It's going to fold, anyway. But repeal and replace Obamacare, people like it. They like the fact that I'm going to protect the Second Amendment, they like the fact that I'm going to rebuild our military which is very depleted. Those are the things that are resonating. And they don't feel Hillary Clinton can do it. John, go ahead, John. Question. [off-mike] Russia has no business in you—that you don't have any... Donald Trump. No, I have nothing to do with Russia, John. How many times do I have say that? Are you a smart man? I have nothing to with Russia, I have nothing to do with Russia. And even—for anything. What do I have to do with Russia? You know the closest I came to Russia, I bought a house a number of years ago in Palm Beach, Florida. Palm Beach is a very expensive place. There was a man who went bankrupt and I bought the house for $40 million and I sold it to a Russian for $100 million including brokerage commissions. So I sold it. So I bought it for 40, I told it for 100 to a Russian. That was a number of years ago. I guess probably I sell condos to Russians, OK? Question. [off-mike] Donald Trump. Of course I can. I told you, other than normal stuff—I buy a house if I sold it to a Russian. I have nothing to do with Russia. I said that Putin has much better leadership qualities than Obama, but who doesn't know that? Question. [off-mike] Donald Trump. Of course not. I own the Trump organization. Zero, zero. Go ahead. Question. [off-mike] Donald Trump. I am. Question. [off-mike] Donald Trump. I did. Question. [off-mike] Donald Trump. I did. Because I would love to see a woman become president of the United States. But she would be so wrong. And even women say that. Women don't like her. She would be so wrong. Look, Hillary Clinton is a disaster. She's been a disaster. And even the story told by her husband last night, he left out the most interesting chapter. I won't get into that. The chapter that I really waited for, because it was pretty boring, the chapter that I waited for, I never heard. And he left it out. Look, Hillary Clinton's a disaster. I'd love to see a woman become president and it'll happen, absolutely. But I think it would be bad for women if it were Hillary Clinton. Yes ma'am? Question. [off-mike] Donald Trump. Yes, I do. Question. [off-mike] Donald Trump. But I have spoken to about many times and I speak about it all the time and the police have to be very careful, they have to be very, very well trained. I speak about it all the time, in fact I mentioned the most recent death, excuse me, I mentioned the most recent deaths in Louisiana and in Minnesota. I speak about it all the time. It's a real problem because if the police do 100,000 great jobs and they have one, either a rogue policeman or a cop who was poorly trained or did a bad job, you see that incident on television for weeks. It's a real problem. You don't see the good work that they do but if they make one mistake out of 100,000, out of more than that, it's on television night after night after night. The police in this country do an amazing job but likewise I agree and I do mention that all the time. Yes, ma'am, go ahead. Question. [off-mike] Donald Trump. Oh, go ahead, go ahead. Question. [off-mike] Donald Trump. Yes. Question. [off-mike] Donald Trump. No, but they seem to be, if it's Russians. I have no idea. It's probably not Russia. Nobody knows if it's Russia. You know the sad thing is? That with the technology and the genius we have in this country, not in government unfortunately, but with the genius we have in government, we don't even know who took the Democratic National Committee e-mails. We don't even know who it is. I heard this morning, one report said they don't think it's Russia, they think it might be China. Another report said it might be just a hacker, some guy with a 200 I.Q. that can't get up in the morning, OK? Nobody knows. Honestly they have no idea if it's Russia. Might be Russia. But if it's any foreign country, it shows how little respect they have for the United States. Yes, ma'am. Question. [off-mike] Donald Trump. Yes. Question. [off-mike] Donald Trump. Well, and the biggest thing is number one we have to stop by keeping people out because these people, they've got something bad going on up there. That's something really bad going on. And then people in terms of Islam and radical Islamic terrorism, a term that our president refuses to use, I can't he's still not using it. He's still not using it. And she doesn't want to use it other than I forced her into maybe using it. She said she will use it but so far she didn't. She'll probably use it tonight. Like the American flags, as soon as we put out a thing they ran a couple of American flags up in the stage, it was a disgrace. You had a room with a massive stage without flags. I think this—I think that the people in the community know what's going on. Whether it's in a mosque or whether it's in the community and they have to report these people. When you look at San Bernardino, people knew—many people knew what was going on. They had bombs lying all over the floor. They had bombs on the floor. I mean, this isn't—you walk into somebody's house, there are bombs lying on the floor—I think there's a problem there. You got to report it. And by the way, David Hinckley should not have been freed, OK? David Hinckley was just released—John Hinckley—I think that John Hinckley—excuse me, John Hinckley, should not have been freed. I just heard about it. [crosstalk] Question. Do you have any pause about asking a foreign government—Russia, China, anybody—to interfere, to hack into the system of anybody's in this country... Donald Trump. That's up to the President. Let the President talk to them. Look, here's the problem. Here's the problem, Katy. Katy, here's the problem, very simple. He has no respect... Question. [inaudible] 30,000 e-mails... Donald Trump. Well, they probably have them. I'd like to have them released. Question. Does that not give you pause? Donald Trump. No, it gives me no pause. If they have them, they have them. We might as well—hey, you know what gives me more pause? That a person in our government, crooked Hillary Clinton—here's what gives me pause. Be quiet. I know you want to save her. That a person in our government, Katy, would delete or get rid of 33,000 e- mails. That gives me a big problem. After she gets a subpoena! She gets subpoenaed, and she gets rid of 33,000 e-mails? That gives me a problem. Now, if Russia or China or any other country has those e-mails, I mean, to be honest with you, I'd love to see them. [crosstalk] Question. A question about Mike Pence, because "The New York Times" reported that [inaudible] conversation with John Kasich's campaign, [inaudible] says, you can be the most powerful [inaudible]... Donald Trump. That's the most ridiculous conversation. He never had the—Don Jr. told me—let me just tell you. Let me save you a lot of boredom. Question. [inaudible] Mike Pence's role as vice president if you are elected? Donald Trump. Mike Pence will play a big role, but I just want to tell you about John Kasich. I never spoke to him about being vice president. We don't have good chemistry together. I have never spoken to him about being vice president. I would never pick him to be vice president. There was never a conversation, and he has a habit of doing things like this where he says things that may be a little bit shaky. He never spoke—Don Jr. would never—and that was so long ago, I didn't even know I was going to get the nomination at that point. Just so you understand, I would not have picked John Kasich, wouldn't be the right guy. I mean, for that to have gotten out, that was so ridiculous. And then, I was going to put him in charge of national and worldwide policy. So what's left for the president? I think you know me better than that. That was put out by him. He's a nice man, John Kasich, he's fine. He's fine. I would never have chosen him. Now, I did speak to various people and I actually got acceptances from many people. There are some people that called me that very much wanted to be vice president, but I picked a man that I have a lot of respect for and Mike Pence is doing a great job. Let me just explain—I never asked John Kasich to be vice president, nor would I. And by the way, I'm leading in Ohio by three points. Question. [inaudible] Donald Trump. It probably has. It probably has. Our government is so weak on this stuff. It probably has. Possible. I mean, I have a lot of checks and balance. I have a good system, I guess. I'm not an e- mail person, myself. I don't believe in it, because I think it can be hacked, for one thing. But when I send an e-mail, I mean, if I send one, I send one almost never. I'm just not a believer in e-mail. A lot of people have taught me that, including Hillary. But honestly, it could be, maybe it's hacked. Who knows? Question. [inaudible] broken the rules in traditional American politics many times. [inaudible] while the other person... Donald Trump. Yes, but my message wasn't dark. My message was optimistic, because we're going to fix the problems. Go ahead. Question. [inaudible] Donald Trump. OK. Question. You've broken that tradition, you've run a very aggressive campaign this week. What was the basis for wanting to do it this way as opposed to staying quiet... Donald Trump. No basis. No basis. Look, John, I didn't have to do this. When I did this, believe me—you see this incredible resort. It's one of the great in the world. When I did this, I could be here enjoying myself. I don't have to be with you guys. I didn't need this. I have places that are the best in the world, OK. I could be doing other things. I'm doing this because we're going to make America great again. I'm doing this because when I looked at the Iran deal, which was incompetent—when I looked at what's going on with jobs being torn out of our country and going to Mexico and China, what's happening with China. And with all of this, with ISIS, with our military being so badly depleted where we have old fighter jets. We have to take parts from museums and from graveyards. When I look at all this I say I sort of have to do it. You know this country's been great to me. I'm giving back. That's all. Now as far as running a campaign, I guess it's probably not typical. But they said that against, you know when I ran there was 17 people, a total of 17. Governors, Senators, Ben Carson who's a fantastic guy, capable people. Wait a minute. Everybody said, oh he can never win because look what he's doing. He's giving a talk to 5,000 people in New Hampshire instead of going to everybody's house and having dinner. And then I won New Hampshire. And then I won you know 38 or 39 states. And won by the way, not by a little bit. Won with the highest vote in the history of the Republican Party. So just... Question. [inaudible] Donald Trump. OK but John but the point is this, so it's a different kind of a campaign. But it's what I think is good. I think it's good. I think it's working here too. Question. But this aggressive counterprogramming the Democratic Convention is different than what we've seen in previous campaigns. And I'm wondering why you felt the need to make sure that everything that was said was responded to immediately with personal appearances, with campaign appearances while they were [inaudible]... Donald Trump. Well, when Joe Biden says that I want to firebomb the enemy, which was on television this morning, or carpet bomb. He used the term carpet bomb. When he makes the statement that Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb, I never said that. That was Ted Cruz that said that OK? That was Ted Cruz, wasn't me. When Sanders, and I think a lot of his people are going to come to me because of trade. But when Bernie Sanders makes a statement that I wanted to go lower than the minimum wage, lower, it's a lie. So I have a choice. All my people say don't respond to it, it doesn't matter. I say to me it does matter. It matters. When people tell lies, politicians who tell lies very well, that's what they do, that's why they're politicians. But when politicians tell lies, and I'm lucky in a sense because I have a big microphone. In other words I can say that Biden lied when he said that. Or I can say that I didn't say that, Bernie Sanders. And you guys know that I didn't. In fact he was criticized by people that fact check for saying it because I never said it. So it's nice to be able to, President Obama said a year-and-a- half ago, Donald Trump will never be president. Today on "The Today Show" he said, this is democracy. A little bit different. Little bit different. [laughter] David, go ahead Dave. Question. Last night at the Democratic Convention [inaudible] women and gay advocates made strong cases that you and the Republican Party are kind of on the wrong side of history regarding abortion rights and gay marriage. Can you clarify your position on those? Donald Trump. You'll have to see it in the polls David. You know what my positions are. You'll have to see it at the polls. Question. I don't know what... [crosstalk] Donald Trump. Yeah go ahead. [crosstalk] Donald Trump. David my positions are down. You ask the question every single time. I give you an answer. My positions are down. Take a look. Go ahead. Question. Didn't you hold a Miss Universe Pageant—? Donald Trump. Yes I did. Question. Did Don Jr. say back in 2008 that there was Russian money pouring into the top organizations... Donald Trump. We wanted to, yeah, I don't know what he said. But we wanted... [crosstalk] Donald Trump. Excuse me, listen. We wanted to; we were doing Miss Universe 4 or 5 years ago in Russia. It was a tremendous success. Very, very successful. And there were developers in Russia that wanted to put a lot of money into developments in Russia. And they wanted us to do it. But it never worked out. Frankly I didn't want to do it for a couple of different reasons. But we had a major developer, particular, but numerous developers that wanted to develop property in Moscow and other places. But we decided not to do it. [crosstalk] Donald Trump. Yes ma'am go ahead. Question. [inaudible] President Obama has said that you would never win the presidency. Last night he said that anything is possible. Donald Trump. He did say that. Question. What is your reaction to that? Donald Trump. Well, I just said sort of said that. He just said that. He said it this morning, anything's possible. I think I'm going to win. I think people are sick and tired of incompetence. They're sick and tired of having politicians leading them down the tubes. Whether it's taxes, whether it's debt, whether it's any one of 15 different things. And that's why. I mean I think I'll win the election. I think you'll see that in the polls. All right a few more questions. Go ahead John. Question. Back in December... Donald Trump. I hope your arm's OK. Question. It's all right. Back in December sir you had said that you were probably going to be going to Israel to go and meet the leadership. Now that you are the Republican nominee, it is a tradition once you secure the Party's nomination, to do a trip... Donald Trump. Well, it's a tradition but I don't do things that are traditional. But I have great support from Israel. I will back Israel 100 percent. I would like to go there. But I have great relationships as you know, to the people in Israel. And by the way, Obama in my opinion is the single worst thing politically speaking that's ever happened to Israel. He has been a disaster for Israel. [crosstalk] Donald Trump. I don't know. I don't know. I haven't set my schedule yet. It could happen. Question. [inaudible] you are the nominee. Has you or your campaign had any conversations with foreign leaders trying to build up a relationship should you win in November, that you don't have to hit the ground running [inaudible]? Donald Trump. No, I think we—it's possible we have. But I'm not—I'm only interested in winning. Once I win, I'll get along great with foreign leaders, but they won't be taking advantage. I mean, the problem we have with foreign leaders, whether it's China, Russia, or anybody, they don't respect our leadership. And certainly in the case of China, they take tremendous economic advantage of us—tremendous, to a point that is hard to believe. I'll get along great with the leadership. And we'll do well. Yes, ma'am, in the back? Question. Mr. Trump, [inaudible] [crosstalk] Donald Trump. No, no. Excuse me. In the back? Question. I would like to know if you became president, would you recognize [inaudible] Crimea as Russian territory? And also if the U.S. would lift sanctions that are [inaudible]? Donald Trump. We'll be looking at that. Yeah, we'll be looking. Go ahead. Question. Mr. Trump, [inaudible] questions. First, a quick one on the minimum wage. You said we need to raise it to $10. [inaudible] be clear here. Are you talking about the federal minimum wage? Donald Trump. Federal. Question. OK. Second question about [inaudible]. Donald Trump. Right. Question. You said [inaudible]. Would religion be a part of the [inaudible]? Donald Trump. I'm not making it a part. But at some point, maybe people will change their minds, but as of right now, I'm not making it a part. OK. [crosstalk] Donald Trump. Yes, ma'am? Go ahead. Question. [inaudible] Donald Trump. Who said that? Question. [inaudible] Donald Trump. Who? Question. [inaudible] Donald Trump. I think President Obama has been the most ignorant president in our history. His views of the world, as he says, don't jive. And the world is a mess. You look at what's happening with the migration, with Syria, with Libya, with Iraq, with everything he's touched. He has been a disaster as a president. He will go down as one of the worst presidents in the history of our country. It is a mess. And I believe that Hillary Clinton will be even worse. Go ahead. Question. [inaudible] polls you [inaudible]. You just said [inaudible]. Donald Trump. Oh, [inaudible] just said that? Many polls show that you are winning? I can't believe it. Are you Katy Turek of NBC? It's a disguise. Go ahead. [laughter] Question. Many polls show you [inaudible]. He said he feels that you are [inaudible] not prepared to be president. Can you [inaudible] lay out for us and for him what you do on a daily basis? How does your [inaudible]? Donald Trump. OK. Well, [inaudible]. [crosstalk] Question. [inaudible] about what's going on [inaudible] and domestic affairs. Donald Trump. Sure. Well, you've been asking me a lot of questions for a lot of times. I've turned out to be right. I turned out to be right on NATO. After I said that on NATO, NATO changed their whole program because of me. Excuse me, Katy, Hillary Clinton said yesterday she's going to start renegotiating trade deals. She never said that in her life. She said it yesterday only because of me. I'm the one that's prepared. President Obama when he became president, he didn't know anything. This guy didn't know a thing. And honestly, today he knows less. Today, he knows less. He's done a terrible job. I think I'm very prepared. Now, with that being said, I've been a businessman all my life, but I've been watching it. I've been seeing it. I've been feeling. And as you know, I've been very much involved in politics from the other side. I understand politics or I guess I wouldn't be here. I mean, I beat a lot of very talented people. Question. [inaudible] advisers, though? Donald Trump. I do. I have great foreign advisers. And you have a list. And I gave you a list. And the other day, as an example, General Quinn and General Flynn, and we have so many—we have so many. As an example, I had a meeting three or four days ago, and I'm going to do a report on it, with seven or eight very, very talented advisers. Now, with all of that being said, a lot of people want the people that are doing it now; people that have certain names. Look at the mess they've gotten us into. They said, "Have you spoken to so and so?" Well, I said, but he was in favor of the war in Iraq many years ago, which I was not in favor of. "Have you spoken to this one or that one?" I said, they were all—look at the job they've done. So a lot of the people that you think are good because you know their name or because you see them on television, I don't think are good. Because look at the end result. The end result is our country is a mess. The Middle East has never been worse. Had we done nothing with the Middle East; had our presidents, with an "S," gone to the beach and relaxed, we'd be in better shape than we are right now. All right, Tom. A couple more. Go ahead, Tom. Question. [inaudible] security briefings. You're about to get one. Donald Trump. Yeah. Question. Do you expect your opinion on [inaudible] or your opinion on [inaudible]. Donald Trump. Well, we'll have to see. I mean, that's my opinion. That's my opinion. We'll have to see. I have a real problem when Hillary Clinton, who gives open access to a phony server, is allowed to get these briefings. How does Hillary Clinton get a national security briefing when she's been probably hacked, when so much of her information, the director of the FBI said it was essentially negligent. It was negligent. Now why are they giving her briefings, why are these people with great knowledge of the inner workings of our country and our security, why are they giving Hillary Clinton briefings? Because it's going to get revealed. I mean her number one person, Huma Abedin, is married to Anthony Weiner, who's a sleazeball and a pervert. And I'm not saying that, I mean that's recorded history, right? I don't like Huma going home at night and telling Anthony Weiner all of these secrets, OK? So how can Hillary Clinton be briefed on this unbelievably delicate information when it was just proven that she lied and that her server shouldn't have had it and that they're missing 33,000 e-mails and that's just the beginning. So I don't think that I know at some point, they're going to be calling, they're going to want to brief me, but I'm not a talker about this stuff. I don't think that it's safe to have Hillary Clinton, in light of what just happened, and in light of what we just found out, I don't think it's safe to have Hillary Clinton be briefed on national security because the word will get out. Question. [off-mike] Donald Trump. No. He's not going to run for mayor. Oh, Don? He's not going to run for mayor. Don has no attention of running for mayor. But he did a great job the other night with his speech. Because he made a good speech, everyone says he should run for mayor. You know why? Because we have a Democratic mayor who's horrible, he's doing a horrible job, de Blasio. But Don is not going to run for—he has no interest in running for mayor. Question. [off-mike] Donald Trump. Yes. Question. [off-mike] Donald Trump. Unbelievable what he said. I think it's disgraceful. Hillary Clinton, because of me, said that TPP is not going to happen. But we all know it is going to happen if she won. Terry McAuliffe said with a wink that if Hillary gets in, she's lying and it will happen. And there is nobody closer, I know this for a fact, there is nobody, including her own husband, closer to Hillary Clinton than Terry McAuliffe, OK? Go ahead. Question. [off-mike] Donald Trump. Oh I don't know what he said, Jon, I really—Anthony Weiner's—look, look, look—Anthony Weiner is a proven loser. I mean the poor guy, he's locked up in a room. They lock him up in a room, they don't let him out. I don't know what Anthony—my son doesn't want to run for mayor. He has no intention of running for mayor. And besides that, as a Republican, you have a very tiny sliver in Manhattan, as you know, and in that area. It's almost impossible for a Republican to win. So, and my son likes to win, but my son has no intention of running for mayor so let's just put that to bed. Go ahead. Question. [off-mike] Donald Trump. Yes, in [inaudible] very sad. Not [inaudible]. Question. [off-mike] Donald Trump. Yes, I'm looking at it. I actually want to find out what causes it. It's a problem in many areas, OK? Yes, go ahead. Question. [off-mike] Donald Trump. Well, they shouted—you know what was interesting. Yesterday I made a speech in front of the great veterans as you saw, and it was very well received, she was there the day before. And when I started talking about Hillary Clinton, the veterans who saw her 24 hours before, started screaming, "Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up." They also screamed that, as you know, during the speech I made. The big speech. Donald Trump. And I said, "Don't do that." Now, I didn't do that for any reason. I really—I didn't like it. And they stopped. Not one reporter said that I said that. They all said—they started screaming "Lock her up! Lock her up." I said, "Don't do that." Nobody reported that I said that, because it's dishonest reporting. You do agree I said that, right? Question. You did say that. Donald Trump. OK. Well, why didn't somebody report that? Question. That's what I want to ask you about, you said you... Donald Trump. No, I think it's—I think it's a shame that they said it, but a lot of people would say that should happen. OK, one more question, yes—yes, ma'am, go ahead. Question. Yes, three weeks is a long time to wait for that [inaudible] immigration. This is Doral, it was built by... Donald Trump. Well, Doral is great. And Doral—I think I have over 1,000 Hispanics working at Doral, and they're doing a great job. Yes, ma'am, in the yellow, go ahead. Yellow. Question. I have another question. Donald Trump. Excuse me. Yellow. Question. Hillary Clinton's running mate... Donald Trump. Who? Question. Hillary Clinton's running mate speaks Spanish. Do you think this [inaudible] an advantage on... Donald Trump. No, I don't think it has any impact. He's been very bad—her running mate has been very, very bad on employment. And all you have to do is go to Virginia and speak to the people of Virginia, he has been so bad. I figured when she chose him, he was very popular in Virginia. They don't like him. They don't like him. It has been very close races, and his polling is very bad. So, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. I think it's time for Hillary Clinton to do a news conference, because it's almost a year now and it would be interesting to see how she does. Thank you all very much. Question. [inaudible] running for the president [inaudible]? Donald Trump. Might as well tell him to have a good time. He has done one bad job. OK, thank you, everybody.
t09.txt:So how good is he? How good is he? [applause] Special. Special. He is a special man and special person. And he has become my friend. Oh, there is a lot of people here. Whoa. [applause] Hello, everybody. Your football team is going to have a great year. [applause] I watch. I watch. You've got the quarterback, you've got the whole deal. I think it's going to be a very good year. [applause] OK? And if you get into that Super Bowl, I will be going, all right? So, you know, I wrote something down before, and I think it is important, because -- I love you too. [applause] Because we need unity, we have to win this election. This is truly one of the most important elections, certainly in my lifetime. Because we are about to go -- we lose it, we are in the wrong direction, and maybe it's gone. Supreme Court justices, always remember that. But so many different levels, and when you see what happened with crooked Hillary today, it was a disaster. [applause] A disaster. She had a disaster. She lies folks, she lies badly. [applause] So, I want to -- I just wrote this out. I wanted to say to the group, you know, I had a great time when I was in Wisconsin, and I did not quite eke it out. I thought I was going to, but after that, it worked out well. You built me up, you taught me about politics.  And when I left here, I said, I think I've learned a lot. [applause] So, I love it. I love the people. I have many friends in Wisconsin. And they're -- they're incredible people. You're incredible people, I have to tell you that. [applause] And we're going to have a lot of fun. We are going to have a lot of fun but I had to write this. This campaign is not about me or any one candidate. It is about America. [applause] It is time for a change. We need a change. A real change, not an Obama change. We don't need an Obama change. We have had enough. It is time to change a rigged political system that works only for the insiders, and replace it with a government that serves the people. [applause] Have to do it. And know both sides. I've been on the other side. Believe me. I actually like this side better; this is a movement. This is a movement like they may be have never seen in this country, according to even the political pundits that truly hate me, OK? This is a -- they -- oh, this is a movement that some say, most say is one of the great phenomenon's that they've ever seen in politics.  Some say it's the single greatest phenomenon. [applause] Though the media doesn't want to talk about it, we have done something -- we. All of us, together. I'm a messenger; I'm only a messenger. We have done something truly historic together, standing before you as nominee for president and I'm not a politician, proudly. [applause] I'm not part of the system. I ran against the system, and I'm probably better off running against the system. [applause] I ran against the donors. I'm my own donor, essentially. I have a lot of money under this deal. This is a very expensive crisis, I want to tell you. [laughter] I funded -- as you know, I funded the primaries. And I'm in for under $60 million, and I'm largely funding my campaign as we go forward. In addition to that -- in addition to that, we have raised tremendous amounts of money, and much of it from small donors,$61; $61. As a Republican, that doesn't happen. It happens because of what you are seeing in front of you today.  And if you remember, just prior to June, they did a story, "Donald Trump has not really done too well with fund raising." Well, that is because I did not even know if I was getting the nomination. I'm not going to raise funds -- I would've had enough if I didn't make it. I would have said, "Bye, bye, politics."  But I wanted to make sure -- so I got it. And then I started raising money for the Republican Party. and we raised a lot of money. We started really on June 14th, Flag Day, my birthday. My birthday. [applause] And in June, we raised approximately -- think of this -- $51 million. Can you imagine? [applause] And those people couldn't believe it; they were really surprised. Big headlines, you know. Because they don't give me too many good headlines. I could do the greatest things. I do things that I think a fantastic.  I say, good, there is no way they cover this badly. And they cover it badly. I gently tell a woman that I love her baby, and let the baby cry. It is OK. As the baby that had a voice that was superior to Pavarotti continued to cry -- I remember, I told her to stay, don't worry, ma'am.  But after about 3 or 4 minutes, and I'm trying to speak and it was in Jacksonville, we had this massive, massive crowd, filled up the stadium. And the baby's screaming. So, I said, ma'am, I would like to reverse my order. Perhaps you could nicely take -- take the baby out. Your baby is great I did it so nicely. She was happy. Even the baby was happy. He stopped crying. [applause] And maybe you could take the baby out, would that be possible? The whole place was cracking up. And the next day in the newspaper, it said, "Trump throws baby out of arena."  Terrible. Now, they are very dishonest. That was a tough one, when I -- and I just had a reporter come up to me, backstage, a reporter come up -- "Mr. Trump, sir, but why did you throw that baby out of the area?" I said, "I was having fun. I was so nice, I was so nice. Everybody likes me. The baby liked me, the mother liked me. We had a good time. I try to keep the baby in, but the baby was such -- had such a powerful voice [applause] In fact, I want to find out who that baby is, because I want to sponsor the baby. And that baby will sing someday in Philharmonic Hall. I'm telling you. New York City. OK? The great Philharmonic. [applause] So, I'm not part of the system. I ran against the system. I ran against the donors, because I'm largely my own donor. I'm running against myself. That's sort of -- never thought of it that way. And against the status quo, and the status quo, we have to get rid of, because it is not working, folks, because the country is a mess. [applause] And that is why put up a lot of money. But while the Democrats nominated the candidate of special interests, and really a candidate of total corruption, I mean, you take a look at what she is doing, the Republicans made history by choosing a nominee from outside of this very, very corrupt the system. It is a corrupt system.  It's a corrupt system. You want something done, they can do it for you. And that is not necessarily, and usually it isn't good for the country. That is why we're going to be able to deliver real change, and real safety and real opportunity to all Americans. We have to unite. Remember that. Everything I've accomplished, I have done by putting together a really fantastic team, including Governor Mike Pence of Indiana, who has done an incredible... [applause] Done an incredible job. My wonderful staff of people that really love what we are doing, and they are working so hard. My family, friends, and it's expanding all the time.  But I need a Republican Senate and a House to accomplish all of the changes that we have to make. We have to make them, right? [applause] I understand and embrace the wisdom of Ronald Reagan's big tent within the party, big, big tent, remember? Ronald Reagan, great man, great guy. Remember he included Reagan Democrats and Independents and Republicans, a lot of people. We're going to have the same thing. There a lot of Democrats perhaps in this room, are there a lot of Democrats? Raise your hands. I mean, I don't think we need too many to be honest with you, but -- so I embraced the wisdom that my 80 percent friend is not my 20 percent enemy, Ronald Reagan. [applause] Stated by Ronald Reagan, pretty good. We will be the big tent party. We are going to have a lot of cross help. We are going to have a lot of Bernie Sanders people coming in because of trade, because Bernie Sanders knew we were being ripped off by trade. Trade is a disaster with China, with Japan, with Mexico, with Vietnam, with so many countries, with every country, every country.  We don't win at any level with anything, and as a unified party, we will lead our country to unity as well, very important. We need the unity, we have to win the election. [applause] No we have to win it --- have to win it. Otherwise, our big movement was not as big as we thought and that's not good. That's why November 8th, you've got to get everybody you know -- and you know, all this voter ID nowadays, a lot of places aren't going to have voter ID. Now what does that mean? What does that mean? You just keep walking in and voting? So you have to be very careful, very vigilant -- you have to be careful But we will have disagreements, but we will disagree as friends and never stop working together toward victory, and very importantly, toward real change. [applause] So in our shared mission to make America great again, I support and endorse our speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. [applause] Paul Ryan, he's good. He's a good man. He's a good man and he's a good guy. And we may disagree on a couple of things, but mostly we agree and we're going get it done and we're going to do a lot of wonderful things. [applause] He's a good man. And while I'm at it, I hold in the highest esteem Senator John McCain for his service to our country, in uniform and in public office, and I fully support and endorse his re-election. Very important. [applause] We'll work together. I also fully support and endorse Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire. [applause] A state I truly love, primarily because that was my first victory, but I love New Hampshire. No, I love New Hampshire, one of the most beautiful places. She's a rising star and will continue to represent the great people of New Hampshire so very well for a long, long time. Senator Kelly Ayotte. [applause] Working hand-in-hand, we will grow our majority in the House and in the Senate. We need that, we've got to get things done. Arm in arm, we will rescue the nation from the Obama-Clinton disaster, which is exactly what it is, that has bled our country dry and spread terrorism unabated across the world, that's what's happening. You saw it just now, Maps came out yesterday, they said ISIS far bigger, it's all over the place. It's all over the place. We're going to get rid of it, folks. [applause] Our military is depleted. We're going to build up our military, we are going to get others with us. Believe me, we're going to get plenty of others with us. And speaking of others, wouldn't it actually be wonderful if we could get along with Russia? Wouldn't that be nice? [applause] They talk so big and so brave and so tough, they're the tough ones. You know, Hillary's real tough, give me a break. Wouldn't that be great? We get along with Russia, we go out together with others and we knock the hell out of ISIS, wouldn't that be great? [applause] Together we will lead our country back to prosperity, security and peace. OK? When you look at the world and what's happened -- so we have the queen of corruption, she's the queen of corruption. She is a disaster. I said before, if crooked Hillary Clinton becomes president, terrorism will destroy the inner workings of our country. Believe me, they are loving it.  She wants to have 550 percent more people coming in from Syria and that region into our nation. And we don't know who they are, we don't know where they come from really, we don't know if they're ISIS, some will be. And look at the damage that's done in San Bernardino with a couple -- probably he became radicalized by her -- a couple, and these were friends of theirs. These were people that gave a party in celebration of the birth of their child and they were gunned down, 14 people killed, many, many injured.  Take a look at Orlando -- take a look at Orlando, how disgusting that was. Take a look at the World Trade Center and so many other places. Go to the probably toughest gun laws anywhere in the world, go to Paris and take a look at that, 130 people gunned down. You know, if people had guns, on the other side where the bullets are flying in the other direction, like you sir, you sir, you and you, ma'am. [applause] First of all, if they knew guns were in the room, they probably wouldn't have gone there. There were no guns. They were just sitting ducks, 130 people. In San Bernardino you had 14 people.  But in Paris, just like this, boom -- get over here, boom -- get over here, boom -- 130 people with many still in the hospital, many so gravely wounded. It's horrible. And if they had bullets flying in the other direction, maybe they wouldn't have shown up, and if they did, I'll tell you what, you wouldn't have had that kind of carnage. You would have had people lying on the other side of the floor instead. [applause] So Hillary Clinton wants to do major damage, as you know, to our Second Amendment. Hillary Clinton wants to put judges -- she wants to put justices of the Supreme Court -- she's going to make them nice and liberal, wait until -- wait until you see what that does to your rights. Wait until you see what that does to your Second Amendment. You will not recognize it, you will not recognize it. National Rifle Association, NRA, endorsed me. [applause] They're great people, Wayne -- they're great people, Chris, they love this country. They endorsed me very early and it's really a -- it's really an honor. I'll tell you what, they are phenomenal people when you get to know them. They love the country -- you know, they love the country. They take a lot of heat, but they love the country, I'll tell you that right now.  And I heard Mike, Governor Pence, talking about 1.2 growth -- 1.2 percent growth, the lowest in memory since the 1940's. When you think about it, it's the lowest. So a lot of differences between all of us, but I thought I would mention -- because I've known Hillary Clinton over the years -- I know her -- and she makes statements. She makes statements and they are statements coming out of her playbook.  Well, let's see, "we can't get them for this -- can't get them for this." I've always heard that I have the best temperament, people tell me I have the best temperament, I have a temperament to win. We got to win. We got to win[applause]  She said not so long ago, "I don't like Donald Trump's tone". Now, she is reading it off teleprompters only. "I don't like Donald trump's tone." And I said, you know, "we need a tough tone today. We have people -- we need a kind tone, but we need a tough tone."  We have people being beheaded all over the Middle East and other places. We have crime that is rampant. We have people in the Middle East being drowned in steel cages. This is like medieval times, and she is worried about my tone.  So they chop off heads and they drown people, and they bury people in sand. And then they ask me, "Mr. Trump, sir," -- at one of the debates in which I won, I'm very happy about that -- "Mr. Trump, sir, how do you feel about waterboarding?" I'm seeing chopped off heads, drowned people, burying in sand -- I said, "I'm absolutely OK with it, let me tell you." [applause] Can you imagine what the enemy must say -- can you imagine the enemy -- ISIS in this case -- can you imagine what they must say as they spent the day chopping off the heads of Christians -- "come back, get together and start talking -- and they say waterboarding is not allowed in the United States -- by the United States, waterboarding is not allowed."  Folks, we better get smart and tough and we are playing games with Hillary, we are playing games. It is just games, she is not the right person and everybody knows it. Her single greatest achievement is being caught in a crime and getting away with it. [applause] This is true, 33,000 e-mails. [applause] So I wrote this before on the way over to another rally at also a very nice place that's very full and very nice in Iowa. And we love Iowa don't we, yes? Right? [applause] I thought it was accurate, unstable -- and she is, she is unstable. Hillary Clinton lacks the judgment that Bernie Sanders had. You just have to pay attention, as soon as he said it, I started writing notes. [applause] "She has bad judgment. She lacks the judgment, temperament and moral character to lead this country. Plus, she is a weak person." We don't need a weak person. He just said, "plus, she is a criminal." She is a dangerous liar who has disregarded the lives of Americans, and who has put all of us at great risk while supporting economic policies that have destroyed our economy. We have a long way to go.  She is unhinged, she's truly unhinged, and she is unbalanced, totally unbalanced. And you can see, in the words of a secret service agent who just wrote a book, I bought the book, I wanted to see what he had to say; "she simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office."  "From my bottom of my soul" he said, "I know this to be true." He was there. "Her leadership style, volcanic impulsive as it is, disdainful of the rules set for everyone else hasn't changed a bit. She's unqualified to become president." And she really is, and Bernie said that too. [applause] Thank you. What great people. Wow. No, but it is true, no games, it is true. In one way she is a monster, OK? Look at what happened, look at her history. In another way, she is a weak person, she is actually not strong enough to be president. So she's got both, but she is not strong enough to be president.  She will be a be a disaster. She will be so bad for our country, and I'm not just talking about Justices of the Supreme Court. She will be so bad for our country and we can't let it happen. We can't let it happen.  You know, Mike Pence told me a story, and maybe I should not say it, but I found it interesting, but of the reasons -- I guess the primary reason that he's in politics is because he watched the crookedness of the Clintons when they were in the White House. And he said "he ran, he ran again and he ran again, and he won." You have to hand it to him, this is the guy that does not give up. He does not quit. He never ever quits. [applause] But he watched the Clintons -- and I'm sure they will be thrilled to hear that -- but that actually got him into politics, which is interesting. So then we make these horrible deals; Iran Deal, horrible deal, we got $150 billion -- and how about $400 million -- think of it, $400 million in cash, different currencies, different denominations. Now, lot of people say that money went toward terror I'm nicer than that, see, I don't have that horrible thought process that some people have in this room have. I say, some of it went to terror, but a lot of it went into their bank accounts, believe me, that's the way it is. It went into their pockets, can you imagine these guys sitting there with $400 million in cash? You think they're giving that money to terror, they are giving that money to them and I guess terror got some of it, but most of it they kept.  I mean, the concept of paying $400 million in cash is mind- boggling. I mean, you wouldn't think -- who can authorize such a thing? Where did they get it? What did they do, go to a bank teller and say, "give me $400 million in cash? I want to in euros, I want it in Swiss francs, wrap it up, we will come back in 10 minutes."  I mean, it is just inconceivable. So we are witnessing a horror show in this country and throughout the world. You look at what is going on throughout the world with these same people, these people funding terror -- these people are funding terrorism. For us to have given $400 million to basically free our hostages.  Now, Obama, just like he lied about Obamacare which was a tremendous lie, that was a tremendous lie, remember? "You can keep your plan, you can keep your doctor." Really? How many people have been able to keep the doctor or their plan?  Keep your plan, keep your doctor -- not working that way, folks. It is a disaster. By the way, it is going to be repealed and replaced 100 percent. [applause] And -- and honestly, I hope I win, because we will do a great job. We are going to make America great again. We're going to make America great again. [applause] But I actually think that regardless of who wins, Obamacare is going to fold in any event. It is so expensive. People can't afford it and the country can't afford it. Other than that, it is just wonderful. So, in Texas, they just had almost a 60 percent increase. Now the increases are starting to come out. The big increase is going to be announced on November 1st. The election is November 8th. Folks, they want to delay it, because it is election-changing. It is a mess.  It is election changing, and they want to change it. And we can't let that happen. Because the numbers -- and I can see some of the numbers already -- the numbers are going to be astronomical. They are going to be astronomical. They're going to be so big, so horrible, and the health care, you know, the plan is terrible. It's terrible. And we're going to take care of everybody, but we're going to end up with a great plan that costs much less money for the people and much less money for the country.  This plan is a total rip. It does not work, so it's going to fall, because economically, it is a disaster for the country, too. But what about people where they said they had a 30, 40, 50, 60 percent increase? And it's going to be worse than that, I predict on November 1st. So, we'd better get smart and we'd better start thinking properly. Now, I want to talk about what is going on at the borders, because money... [applause] Oh, we're going to build it. So, listen, so we have people coming to our country that should not be coming to our country . We have thousands and thousands of people from certain terrorist states, from certain parts of the world that we are allowing to come into our country. Most of the politicians, almost all of them don't even know where they are, where they are being put, they know nothing about these people. This could be the great Trojan Horse of all time. And Hillary wants thousands more to come in over and above Obama. Right?  So, tall -- and the wall is getting taller every day. [applause] If you think of this, I just wrote this, the Obama-Clinton foreign-policy has handed huge portions of Iraq, Libya and Syria to ISIS. Huge portions. It has undermined stability in Egypt, and you know what they have to do over there. And empowered Iran as never before. Iran, three years ago was -- was dying. In fact, when they were marching in the streets, if Obama would have just encouraged them a little more, it would have been taken over by the people.  But Obama played ball with the thugs that are running it right now. Think of this, think of this. Look, look. We're making a deal, and the deal is not made, and they are dancing in the streets of Iran saying how stupid the Americans are to be making this deal.  The leaders, and in particular the leader of Iran, is calling us stupid, and the deal means nothing. And yesterday, I think he just said that the United States is essentially nothing. This is our -- this is our great, great partner. But when you have somebody -- if I was making this deal, and if the other side was bragging about it, the deal wasn't made, I'm not making that deal. I'm not making it. I'm walking.  But we kept it going, and we should have never ever started negotiating that deal until we had our hostages back. OK? [applause] We should have walked. We should have doubled up the sanctions and walked. And they would have -- and I say it. Before the plane reached New York City or Washington, you could just turn it around, because they'll call you, they'll say, let's go. Take your hostages.  But when you think about it, you probably read today and yesterday, one of the hostages was waiting for a very long period of time. Now, Obama said that it had nothing to do with the hostages. That he would not do that for kidnappers.  He would not do that for kidnapping. OK? No, no, think of that. You have got to think about it. He wouldn't do it -- now, it was the same day, right, same day. We have to be exactly accurate, because they'll catch us, right? Same day.  The money came in, and one of the hostages, a good guy, I saw him interview on television. Good guy, hard time. Btu didn't he say he waited forever, he waited. And somebody said, nope, we are waiting for either something or a plane to come in.  And here Obama stands up yesterday, and for seven minutes is telling us one thing had nothing to do with the other. Just a lie. You know, at least be truthful. [applause] And we're talking about the same day, $400 million, and we could have had something that would have been a much better deal. And you know what, I'm all in favor of deals when it gets to nuclear. But we could have made it -- we should have walked. And we should have walked with $150, too; we have said, sorry, we don't have the money, can't pay. We don't have the money. We owe almost $20 trillion I'm sorry, fellas, we love you, we think you're the greatest guys on Earth. But we can't give you the money. We don't have it. And they will get angry and they will be upset, and two days later, you'll be back negotiating.  You just saved yourself $150 billion, right? Hundred and -- $150 billion. [applause] So, we have terrorists pouring into our country, we have people coming in. I don't know if you saw this, in Maine -- and Maine knows, because Maine is -- I was up there yesterday -- a great place. A great governor, great governor. Paul is doing a great job.  And I think the most important issue facing civilization right now is radical Islamic terrorism. And we have a president that refuses to use the term, and we have crooked Hillary who does not want to use it. Now, she's being forced to use it by me.  Did you notice she gave a speech, she said, I will use it. She called it, I think, radical Islam. But she said, I will use it. I will. Just like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. She called it the gold standard. It is a horror show.  It's almost as bad or maybe it's going to worse than NAFTA, signed by her husband, which cleaned out many of the states in our country, cleaned them out from manufacturing. Moved to Mexico and other places. NAFTA, a total disaster.  NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton. He never suffered the ravages, because he signed it, then he got out and other people did suffer with it. But we are going to renegotiate NAFTA, and if they don't want to make a great deal for us so we get our jobs back, at least a lot of them, if we can't make a great deal -- and she can't do that, by the way, if she wanted to.  Number one, her donors would not let her. Her special interests would never let her. Her lobbyists would never let her. Number three, she could not do it anyway. Even if she wanted to. But we're going to renegotiate. And did you hear her the other day? After years of saying how wonderful it is, even though you look at New England, and you look at New York state and you look at Pennsylvania and Ohio, if you look at a lot of other places, one of the reasons I won Indiana so big -- well, one of the reasons was the great Bobby Knight, OK?  Bobby Knight in Indiana. [applause] That's gold standard right? As she said about TPP. But one of the reasons I won was because Carrier Air Conditioning was moving to Mexico from Indiana, and they let go of 1,400 people.  And I've been talking about this, and I know how to stop it, and you've heard me before, so easy to stop. There have to be consequences when Mexico takes our companies. And not only Mexico; there have to be consequences when China devalues its currency so that our companies can no longer compete with China, even though we make better product.  I have friends who are manufacturers. We make better product. They can't get their product into China And when a few times arise where they can, they have to pay an incredible tax, beyond what anybody would even think costs. But yet, we open our doors and just throw away your stuff, and we lose our jobs and it is very, very said.  But look, as many know, a major destination -- Maine, has become a major destination for Somali refugees. We admit hundreds of thousands of refugees into the United States from many of the most dangerous and unstable regions in the world. And you are getting them here too folks, you just don't know it because you just don't know.  Anybody in this room -- anybody in this room from a terror territory? All right, a practice -- and this is a practice which will continue under Hillary Clinton except it will expand five, six, seven fold. I don't get it. I mean, I know they will vote Democrat, OK, that's what I know, but they will not be voting for a long time.  I just -- I don't get it, how can anybody even think this way? Now, the Washington Times reported, "of the Somali refugees -- the program in Minnesota -- that the effort to resettle large groups of Somali refugees is having the unintended consequence of creating an enclave of immigrants with high unemployment that is both stressing the state safety net" -- tremendous problems for safety -- "and creating a rich pool of potential recruiting targets for the Islamic terror groups Aren't we smart? We are having this problem across our refugee and immigration programs. Here are some of the examples -- I will give you a few examples, and this came out of the Senate subcommittee just recently. "The Boston bombers" -- remember those horrible, disgusting people? "The Boston bombers arrived through the political asylum process.  The younger brother applied for citizenship and was naturalized on September 11, 2012. The older brother had a pending application for citizenship." And look what happened, we took them in. Look what happened, aren't we smart?  The Moroccan national who came to the United States on a student visa was arrested for plotting to blow up a university in a federal courthouse. Great. A Uzbek refugee living in Idaho was arrested and charged with providing support to a terrorist organization in the form of teaching terror recruits how to build massive and very dangerous bombs. We let him in.  An immigrant from Syria who later applied for and received U.S. citizenship was accused by federal prosecutors of planning to go to a military base in Texas and kill three or four American soldiers, execution style if possible -- more than that, if at all possible.  A college student who immigrated from Somalia who later applied and received U.S. citizenship, attempted to blow up a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Oregon.  An immigrant from Afghanistan who later applied for and received U.S. citizenship, and a legal permanent resident from the Philippines were convicted for plotting to join Al Qaida and the Taliban in order to kill as many Americans as possible -- as many as possible.  An Iraqi immigrant who later applied for and received U.S. citizenship was arrested for lying to federal agents about pledging allegiance to ISIS, his travels to Syria, and how many Americans he wanted to kill.  Two immigrants from Pakistan who later applied for and received U.S. citizenship were sentenced to decades long prison sentences for plotting to detonate a bomb -- and a very big bomb, in the middle of New York City.  An immigrant from Yemen who later applied for and received U.S. citizenship was arrested for trying to join ISIS. He was also charged with attempting to illegally buy firearms to try to shoot as many American military personnel as possible.  All right folks. So, I just say, what are we doing? What are we doing? And Hillary Clinton wants more and more to pour in. You can almost say, you know, politics aside, whether you are a Democrat, whether you are a liberal, a Republican, a conservative; what are they doing? I don't care who you are, what the hell are they doing? [applause] So we are going to have strong borders, our southern border is going to be very powerful. We are going to stop the drugs from pouring into Wisconsin and every place else. [applause] The heroin epidemic is beyond belief. In New Hampshire, a great place, that is where I realized the extent of what is going on. I met with the people of New Hampshire and they tell me, "the biggest problem they have is heroin." I said, "it can't be with the beautiful lakes and streams, it so beautiful." Right, and their biggest problems heroin. I said, "you have to be kidding, that can't be right, " and it was. Their youth is being poisoned. And then you go to Massachusetts, and you go to North Carolina, and South Carolina, and you come here, you come here -- I just left Iowa, you go to Iowa and you see the tremendous problems they have with heroin and drugs that pour in from the southern border. And look, here's the story, we are going to have strong borders. We are going to have a wall, it will be a big and powerful wall -- a big powerful wall. [applause] You know that Hillary Clinton wanted a wall a number of years ago? She wanted a wall. And the primary research, as we understand it, looking back, not that long ago, she wanted a wall. You know, walls do work folks, all you have to do is ask Israel. All you have to do is ask some of the nations that are in Europe right now that are building walls.  You know, it's sort of interesting, Obama talks about, "there will be no wall." But in the White House, which he just said, which is true, they want to build essentially a wall, they want to build a fence a lot bigger, and a lot higher, and a lot stronger.  You know, it is interesting. I say, "don't build that fence right, don't build that fence," because they say, "walls don't work" -- fences don't work, don't build that fence."  When Hillary doesn't want to let you have your guns, she is surrounded by people like this that have more firepower on them than any human beings on earth, and I think she doesn't want to have guns. I think that all of her bodyguards and all of her Secret Service should immediately give up their weapons. [applause] OK, I mean it. They should immediately give up their weapons. They should immediately give up those weapons and if somebody comes at you with a gun, you just try to talk them out of it, I guess. You got to do some quick talking.  You got to do some quick talking, Hillary. I don't think even Hillary with her phony lies and disgusting habits, I don't think Hillary could get away with that one. [applause] So we are going to have a little contrast. And I did this very quickly but it is so simple, Hillary wants to raise taxes, Trump is going to lower taxes very substantially, the biggest tax decrease of all on business and on person.  Hillary wants to significantly expand regulations.[booing] Trump is going to get rid of many, many, many regulations. [applause] Which, by the way, are stopping your businesses both small and big from succeeding, from expanding and more than anything, from starting. You can't start a business today the regulations are so onerous and horrible.  Hillary wants to shut down energy production. [booing] Trump wants to expand it significantly. And we'll start paying off our debt. [applause]  Hillary wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment, take away your right. [booing] Donald Trump will protect it more so than any president that has ever served. [applause] Crooked Hillary wants far left activities judges forced over there by Bernie and by Pocahontas. [laughter] Who will destroy our Constitution. I want judges who will support and defend our Constitution. [applause] As close, by the way, to Justice Scalia who was great as we could get, OK? [applause] Hillary wants to open our borders, just open them up because her special interests and donors want it that way. There are reasons, I understand that. I want to totally secure our borders. But I want people to come in. But they come in through a process and they come in legally. [applause] Hillary wants to invade foreign countries. You ever see the one where she says "Donald Trump with the nuclear" -- I'm -- I didn't want the war in Iraq. And I'm on record. I didn't want the war in Iraq. I didn't want all of -- what they've done. And I said, if you read Esquire Magazine from a long time ago, you'll see everything I said was exactly right. It's going to de-stabilize the Middle East.  I said the meanest, toughest group of people, the people that hate the United States and its people the most, they're going to take it over. That's exactly what's happening. They're taking over the oil, they're taking over the land, they're taking over everything. I didn't want it, but I'm always being accused like the war hog they think I'm a tough guy, the war hog. Right?  They think she wants to be tough with Russia. So she said well, Donald Trump likes Putin. I don't know Putin, folks. I don't know. I hope I like him, I hope he likes me because I'd love to get along with Russia. OK? [applause] Love to. But I don't know. But she goes Donald Trump, Donald Trump -- think about it -- wants to befriend Putin and other things, she said right? And I'm saying to myself what's wrong with that? That's good.  But she's going to be the tough one, see? She's going to be the tough one. She's going to play with nuclear weapons, you know? They have all the nukes, nice nukes. She's going to be the tough one.  I'll tell you what, you put her in the office of the president -- you know, she hates Putin and Putin hates her, right? That's what I hear. No, no -- Putin probably doesn't respect her more than anything else. But Putin hates her. But she's going to be tough. We're going to be tough with Russia -- oh, we're going to be tough, right? Let me tell you, we're in a different world today, folks. We're in a different world.  But she makes it sound like I'm this tough guy that will have a temperament. You know, she uses the word -- you know who gave her the word? Her people that write the speeches, we'll say Trump with a temperament.  They said Trump in a speech with tweets. I've got -- I've got between Facebook and Twitter like almost 21, 22 million people. It's an asset, it's an asset. I tweet well. But -- but she said -- she made the statement during her speech, you know, I heard it barely because I was falling asleep, you couldn't watch it. [laughter] All right. So remember that one. Hillary wants to invade foreign countries. Look at Libya. Look at that. We did a great job there. You know, a spot hit on Gaddafi maybe, but I mean even that, what the hell do we get out of this? It's a disaster. Then you have Benghazi, then you have ISIS -- then you have ISIS -- then you have ISIS taking over the oil, large portions of the oil. And it's some of the finest oil in the world. And you have ISIS grabbing it. We don't know what we're doing. We have people that don't know what we're doing. We have people that militarily -- in fact, they said well, who is your military consultants? And I give them names. But they're not working now, you know they're not working now. And I said of course they're not working now, look what working now people have gotten us. Havoc, who the hell wants the people who are working now? I mean... [applause] You know, a lot of it's common sense and a lot of it's instinct and she has very bad judgment, she's got no instinct whatsoever. And when I was asked on one of the big networks about NATO, they said what do you think of NATO? Now, you know it's not like it was my primary subject in all fairness. I've only been doing this for 12 months. Now, it's actually almost 14 months, hard to believe, right?  But NATO -- so I said I know enough. And sometimes knowing a little is better than knowing too much. You understand, you can't see the forest through the trees, right? So I said NATO in my opinion is obsolete because it's not covering terrorism. Obsolete for that reason and also you have many countries that aren't paying their fair share, they're not paying what they're supposed to be paying. [applause] And we're protecting those guys and we're supposed to get into World War III for all these countries that aren't paying their fair share. And even the commander of NATO -- and I so respect what he did. He came out the other day and he said Donald Trump is right, we have cut you see that's right did you see the letter -- the big story? Donald Trump is right. I'm sure Obama was thrilled when he saw that. [laughter] Donald Trump is right; you have countries that aren't paying. And he said how he goes in and he talks to them. He says look, you've got to pay your bills. I have budgets -- which is true. And I have to go back to Congress and I have to say what's happening.  They don't pay their bills though because people don't ask properly. And they probably say to the president or whoever may handle the country. "Sir, we owe the United States millions of dollars. We're ready to pay." Oh, have they asked for the money? No. They'll pay, OK But I will say the commander of NATO said I was right. And then you have these people back here -- stupid people -- right here. They said Donald Trump -- now they're the worst. They're the worst. They said Donald Trump -- Donald Trump doesn't like NATO. He is going to abandon NATO. That's not what I said. I said they've got to pay. They've got to pay.  Now, you have to walk. You may have to walk. But they've got to pay. We're going to get in World War III for all these countries that are laughing at the stupidity of the United States, right? No, they've got to pay. And they probably will, in all fairness.  But Hillary said about Japan -- because Japan, we're defending Japan you know that, right? Now, in all fairness before I came alone put yourself back three years ago. Did anybody know that we defend Japan? Raise your hand who knew. All right, there's about 12 percent.  Not bad. I think some of you are lying, OK? I think some of you are related to Hillary Rodham Clinton. I think some of you are lying. But we defend Japan and a man comes up, general or something, a few months ago, I remember so vividly. And he said at a news conference because they were embarrassed because I kept saying they've got to pay their way. And if they don't -- if they don't, you always have to be prepared to walk you have to do that.  You know, we don't want to do that, I understand the reason. It'd be nice to have them but you know this isn't again 40 years ago. We owe $20 trillion. We're defending all these -- we defend Japan. We defend Germany. We defend Saudi Arabia. You think they have the money to pay -- how about we have military bases that we rent -- we pay rent to Saudi Arabia to protect them? No. No, think of it. Think of it, think of the stupidity. Think of the stupidity. So this general comes up, has a news conference a few months ago. And he said, "Mr. Trump doesn't understand that Japan is paying 50 percent of the cost to defend them."  So a reporter goes up who I think is there and said to me, "Mr. Trump, we'd like your comment. They say that Japan is paying 50 percent of the cost to defend." And I said why aren't they paying 100 percent? The reporter said, OK." Not a bad question. Now, here's the problem with the Hillary -- Hillary rotten Clinton. Here's the problem. [applause] Here is -- that's why she changed her last -- that's why she doesn't want to use the name anymore, because everybody was saying that. I don't know. I've been saying it.  But look, here is -- here is why it doesn't work for Hillary. She saw that I said that we have to get reimbursed for our costs, at least, right? Japan, economic behemoth. Germany -- see how well they're doing -- economic behemoth. Saudi Arabia, nothing but money. They were making $1 billion a day with their high oil prices, now they're making a fortune, the same thing. Economic behemoth. Why are defending them, and why aren't we being fully reimbursed? Now, if we do that, your budget already is starting to look real good, OK. You know, you have budgets, so we losing our assurance; we have an $800 billion trade deficit, folks. We trade with companies. We have a deficit with other countries, think of it -- $800 billion a year. Trade deficit. Do we make the deals? no. With China, $505 billion trade deficit. And they cheat us because they devalue their currency all the time. Whenever it gets a little bit tough, devalue, devalue, and our companies can't compete with that. Right?  So, here's the thing. So, Hillary says about Japan, how dare he not not stay with our allies, how dare he not do that? I will never abandon our allies, ever, ever, ever. Now, how do you negotiate when you're telling somebody will never going to leave? We may have to leave.  Look, Japan has problems because you have the maniac in North Korea making missiles. But I mean, you know, so we'll get it. Now, South Korea, it is an economic behemoth. You can't buy television that is not made in South Korea, except Sony, which is made in Japan, which has sort of lost its way. Whether it is LG or Samsung. I order thousands of television sets; you can't buy them in the United States. I'd love to. Show me one company. One of the pundits said, they do make them. There's a company.  And he showed me, it's a little company. What they do is, all the parts come in for -- from all over the world; they put them together, and they give you a television that doesn't work and nobody ever heard of it. [applause] And then I put it into a luxury hotel, and everybody complains, right? So, you can't say to people when you're negotiating -- because we're talking about tremendous billions and billions of dollars. You can't say to people -- you can't say to people when you're negotiating, we'll never leave you.  Think of this, we're going to never leave you; we love you, we'll never leave you. Could you pay more? No, we're not going to pay anymore. You're not going to leave us. Why should we pay more?  So, there's a chance we'll have to leave. And there's a chance that, you know, Japan will have to take over this monster and figure it out. We're very far away. It's very expensive.  You know, we have a treaty with Japan. And if the United States is attacked, they don't have to do anything. But if Japan is attacked, we have to go in there will our full force and might, and who the hell knows what's going to happen, right World War III, who knows what's going to happen. But if we're attacked, they don't have to do anything. You tell me, who makes these deals? It's like Sergeant Bergdahl, right? So, we trade a dirty, rotten traitor where five or maybe even six people were killed when he deserted, and we knew that they were killed and we knew that he was a traitor. We trade for five of the greatest killers, the greatest killers in the Middle East, the five people that they wanted the most. That is our deal.  So, we get a traitor and they get five people that are right now, most of them, already back on the battlefields trying to kill everybody, including us.  No more, folks. That is called the five for one president. That's -- that is the same guy that made the deal for $400 million. The other guys couldn't leave the airport, the hostages. And then all of a sudden, they were able to leave.  And then you watched him yesterday saying that, can you believe it? This had nothing to do with that. OK? Just a coincidence. No, no, just a coincidence -- no. You know, she is unfit to serve as president for a lot of reasons. He is unfit also. He has done so bad. He has been so incompetent. We have doubled our debt during his -- think of it. Over the years of our country -- over the years of our country, he gets in, and in eight years by the time his term is up, we will have doubled our national debt.  Think of it. So, we have to win this election. This is a very important election. I do not need to do this, folks, believe me. I could be elsewhere right now, I love being with you.  But I could be elsewhere. I could be -- I might be in Wisconsin, just a different location. OK? But I felt I had to do it. I want to give back. I will get back give back, I'm going to give back. I'm going to give back. [applause] I want to give back. Because our country does not win anymore. Our country does not win anymore. And it is not going to win with crooked Hillary Clinton. Not going to win. It's not going to win. She does not know how to win. Our country is not going to win with her.  We're going to be worse than we are with Obama. I mean, if you want four more years of what is going on, ISIS, all over the place, ISIS expanding. And by the way, our policeman are great, great people. [applause] And we are not going to allow our policeman to be shot down anymore. Anymore. No more. No more. So, November 8th, you have a big election. I promise you this, if I win, we're going to start winning again. We are going to win on trade, we're going to win with our military, we're going to take out ISIS, we are going to win for our veterans who have been totally mistreated.  Our veterans are great. We have a great plan for the veterans. We're are going to win for our veterans, first time, maybe ever. We are going to win on trade deals. We are going to make the finest, we are going to bring our jobs back. We're not going to make it easy for these companies to leave and fire everybody. It going to be very, very expensive when they do it.  Believe me, it's going to be very, very expensive. They're going to say, you know what? Maybe we'll stay Wisconsin, OK? Maybe we will stay. [applause] No, it's going to be very, very hard. We're going to have strong borders, we're going to have the wall. Mexico is going to pay for the wall 100 percent, 100 percent. [applause] We are going to get rid of Obamacare. We're going to get rid of Common Core, we're going to bring our education -- local. We're going to have local education.  We're going to appoint great Supreme Court justices. [applause] And folks, we're going to start winning again. We're going to win at every level. We're going to win so much, you're going to get tired of winning, I'm telling you.  You're going to be begging me, Mr. President -- you will send your great quarterback, right? He will come to the White House. Everybody respects him. He'll come to the White House, and he'll say, Mr. President, the people of Wisconsin, they can't stand winning so much. [applause] Could you tone it down just a little bit? I will say, I just can't do that. We are going to win more, and more and more, we're going to win at every level.  But we are going to win. We are going to make America great again. We're going to make America safe again. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you.
t12.txt:Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Unbelievable. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. It's a great honor. Thank you. [applause] Amazing. Amazing. What great people. We're going to bring back our jobs to Pennsylvania. We're going to bring back our jobs to the United States. [applause] Going to bring back our jobs, folks. I've looked at the numbers and I see what's happening in Pennsylvania. I see what's happening all over our country. You look at New York state, you look at New England, you look anywhere in the country where you want to go to, all over it's the same. Manufacturing way down, jobs way down. You go to other countries, they're taking our companies, they're taking our jobs.  People are right now working harder than they've ever worked. Eighteen years ago they made more money in real wages, 18 years, think of it. Eighteen years ago many of the people in this incredibly big room, and thank you for being here, you know it's 93 degrees out. [applause] And they still have a lot of people trying to get in, I don't know if they can get them in. Should we let them in? Just let them in. [applause] But 18 years ago, people were making more money in real wages than they make today. And today they're working two jobs, some people are working three jobs. So they're older, and they're working harder, and they're making less money, all right? A friend of mine, I've been telling this story over the last month because it's better than going to Wharton or better than going to Harvard and asking them to do a study, because you learn it in three minutes.  But let me just tell you. Right now, Mexico and other countries are building facilities, plants, the likes of which you've never seen. We're going to build the wall, don't worry, we're going to build the wall, we're going to build it, we're going to build it. [applause] But a friend of mine, and actually a supporter, big supporter, great guy. He builds plants, that's what he does, he builds plants. He doesn't want to build apartments, he doesn't want to build office buildings, he wants to build plants. And he's just about the biggest there is. And I said how are things going? He said very well, how are you doing in the U.S.? Not good. How are you doing in Mexico?  He said Donald do you want to see, it's the eighth wonder of the world. They are building plants, the likes of which I've never seen. He's building some of the greatest plants, big—you look at Ford moving vast operations to Mexico. The plants. You look at—look at, take a look. By the way, millions of jobs, thousands of companies over the years, they've left us. And we have a few things. We have unemployment, we have empty plants, I saw up in New York state, I saw it in Pennsylvania, you were great to meet, you voted a big victory for Donald Trump, thank you. [applause] That was a big victory. I mean I assumed I was going—if I don't win Pennsylvania—and by the way, I was talking to our great Congressman, and where is he? He's here some place, where is he? [applause] He loves the people, and I have to say, of all of Pennsylvania he wants to see this state do well. Thank you. But just talking back to a few of my friends that live here, we have a few of the friends and we see what's happened with General Electric where they're cutting way back. Not going to happen. And you know why they're cutting back, it's one reason. Because we don't take care of our miners and we're not producing coal.  And they don't need to make those big, big beautiful, you could call them locomotives I guess, right? Whatever the hell they are, they're big and they're powerful and they don't need them like they used to because we don't make our government work for us. They're not working for us. They're working for others, they're not working for us. So when General Electric goes out and you see the numbers, I see the numbers, and it's about coal, so I just left parts of Virginia and West Virginia, and the coal industry's decimated.  The miners are out of work, they're totally out of work. I mean there will be no such thing as coal in this country pretty soon. And we're talking clean coal, we're talking clean coal. So I was with the miners, we have such tremendous support, West Virginia, the mining parts of Virginia. All over, Ohio, because Hillary Clinton made the statement not so long ago. A number of months she said, we're going to put the mines and miners out of business. All right? Going to put the mines and the miners  so [booing] So, we're not going to let that happen. We're not going to let that happen and we're not going to let it happen in Pennsylvania because you know what? A lot of your miners have already lost their jobs, but you have a lot of other jobs that are very reliant on the mines. Like, as an example, General Electric. And what we're going to do, folks, is going to be so special. We're going to bring it back. We're going to bring back our jobs, we're going to bring back our companies. [applause] When a company wants to leave our country to go to another country and think they're going to make their product, and because our politicians are weak, stupid, taken care of by lobbyists, special interests—they're taken care of by lobbyists, they're taken care of by donors and special interests. That's what—you know, a friend of mine—very smart guy—said—I can't believe it. We're talking about a deal that took place about a month ago.  He said, I can't believe they could have gotten that through. I said, Why can't you believe it? Well, it's so bad for the country. I said, Yeah, but it's good for the politician because they're taken care of by their lobbyists and their donors and the special interests.  So even though you say we want, as an example, General Electric to produce more, if they don't want to or if for some reason one of the donors of crooked Hillary Clinton doesn't want that to happen, even though it's great for Erie, even though it's great you, even though it's great for the state of Pennsylvania, then it's not going to happen, folks. It's not going to happen.  And by the way—and I have to tell you this. So when they think they're going to take our companies are rip them out of—as an example—this area or this state or any other state and go to Mexico and build massive new plants and employ people other than you, and you're going to lose your jobs or you're going to now get two part- time jobs that don't add up to half of what you used to make. That stuff isn't happening anymore. So here's what happens. They're going to build that plant. Now, if I were here five years ago and if President Obama put me and maybe secretary of keeping business in the United States—that's my title, secretary of keeping business in the United States. [applause] I mean, I like the sound of secretary of defense better. Oh, and by the way, we're going to build our military. We're going to be very strong. [applause] Really. And we're going to take care of our vets. We're going to take care of our vets, believe me. [applause] But I like the sound—I like the sound of secretary of Defense. I like the sound of secretary of the Treasury. I like the sound of secretary of State. But I'll tell you, would I be good at keeping jobs over here. Would I be... [applause] I'll tell you this. I just have to say the Bernie Sanders protesters were much, much stronger. They had much more passion, I have to say. [applause] All right. You know what's interesting? If I could speak to them for like five minutes—we want a strong military, we want to take care of our people, we want good education, we want good housing, we want good healthcare. What do we want? We're all in for the same thing. [applause] Really amazing. Really amazing. So I'll be your secretary of keeping companies in the United States, right? So, I would go to a company like Carrier Air Conditioner, which decided to leave Indianapolis, Indiana, and I would say here's the story.  We think it's wonderful that you're negotiating with Mexico. I'm sure you're going to have a wonderful plant, but here's what's going to happen. If you build that plant and you fire all of these people, 1400 people who were so great to me.  Indiana, I won that in a landslide. Actually, the timing was good. I won it in a landslide because I know what to do. Hillary doesn't know what to do. Did you see her yesterday? She has no clue about what we're talking about. Folks, she has no clue. She has no clue. Crooked Hillary. She doesn't know anything about it and, by the way, if she did, she couldn't do it anyway because her donors don't want to do it. There's reasons.  But look, look. I would go to them and say just to keep them. Just to keep them. And I wouldn't even care that much. I'll tell you why. Ready? I'd say here's the story.  If you leave, in this case, Indianapolis, you're going to go to Mexico, you're going to make your air conditioning units. Every single unit that you make that crosses our now very, very strong border we're going to charge you 35 percent of the cost of that unit. OK? Thirty five percent. Right?  So simple. Thirty five percent the cost of that unit. We hope you enjoy your new plant. Very hot weather out there, very hot. We hope you enjoy your new plant, but 35 percent is coming to us. Now, here's what's going to happen if they haven't moved yet. A lot of them have moved.  We've lost thousands and thousands of companies, we've lost millions of jobs - too late. I should have been there 10 years ago. Nobody would have left. Nobody would have left because you need the right messenger, you know, I'm your messenger in terms of this movement.  But you need the right person saying it. So, here's what's going to happen. Normally they'd call up whoever it is that was putting the little order down like the new president and they'd have one of their lobbyists call up and they'd say Hillary, I'm sorry, you can't do that, they gave you $2 million for your campaign. Can't do that, Hillary. OK, I won't do that.  With me, I'm putting my money up, folks. I'm putting my money up. Putting my money up. We're raising money for Reince and for the RNC, but that's for a lot of other reasons. We are putting - I'm putting a lot of money up. I financed my - I funded, not financed, I wish I financed, right? I funded but I funded my primaries and I spent less than anybody else in terms of the measures. So, here's a story - wouldn't that be nice?  I spent less and won in a landslide. Other people spent much, much more. Three, four, five times more and they came in seventh. Who the hell do you want to have as your president, right? Right? Right? Oh, boy, and then they don't like me - couple of them, most of them have really supported us, but some of them just can't get over it. You know what I say to them? Get over it. We're just having fun. Get over it.  You signed a pledge, I hereby guarantee that I will endorse whoever wins - you know, the funny thing, all those pledges, you know they were signed for different - they were signed so that I would sign it. And I would have honored it, I will say. Even if I wasn't fond or didn't like - I would have honored it because a pledge is a very important thing. But here's the thing. So, we are going to take these companies that haven't left - now, I'm looking at your numbers folks, you're not doing too well.  You're not doing too well here. Pennsylvania has lost one in three manufacturing jobs since - you know, that's massive, since NAFTA. NAFTA was signed by Bill Clinton and I believe it's the single worst trade document ever signed in the history of our country and probably in the history of our world.  It's one of the most one-sided documents that I've ever seen. And it allowed Mexico and places to do unbelievably well at our expense. And did you see where say, I'm going to renegotiate NAFTA, I'm going to—TPP disaster. Ok, don't worry. Don't worry.  And Hillary was in favor of TPP. She said it's the gold standard. Thank you for reminding me. I like this guy. It's the gold standard. TPP. Transpacific Partnership. It is going to be—I don't think you can be worse than NAFTA honestly. But it's going to be as bad as NAFTA. So TPP, she said it is the gold standard. She's reading it from a teleprompter. It is the gold standard—oh, boy. Our country is in trouble. Our country is in trouble. Our country is in trouble.  So she said it's the gold standard. But when she heard me make a speech, as I understand it. And she heard me talking very negatively about it. As an example, they don't talk devaluation, which is the single greatest tool that these countries are using to kill the United States, including China. They devalue their currency. Well, it doesn't happen. Number one thing is not mentioned.  So complicated, this agreement. Too many countries. By the way, I believe trade. I believe in trade deals. One country at a time. Boom. Boom. Boom. You got to see the lines. We'll have one line. And if they don't do well.  If they don't behave themselves, if they want to start devaluing their currency all over the place, very simple, we write them a notice like we do in business. We serve them with a 30 day notice. [applause] And by the way, you just saw, how great are our police, right? [applause] Law and order. We need law and order. We need law and order and we will have law and order. Our police, our firemen - but our police do a fantastic job. They are not recognized for the great job they do. If they have 500,000 incidents all positively, beautifully handled, one bad thing happens, that one bad thing is on the news for two weeks and it's a disgrace. It's a disgrace.  So we should be very thankful for the job they do. So, Pennsylvania is losing a lot of its business. Right now, we're sitting here, we're talking - oh, here's another one. Go home to Mom. Go home to Mom. [applause] And your mother is voting for trump! She's voting for Trump. It's true. It's true. By the way, just to interject - so I was told this whole area is Democratic, meaning Democrat. And I was told that by a lot of different people outside and then they said I can't believe that you have 10,000 people, you have people outside trying to get in.  They said, the came up to me, this is - happens to be a Democrat who I happen to know is a good guy—came up to me and said I've never seen anything like it. It always goes Democrat. Is that a correct statement? Said, you are going to win Erie in a and the surrounding area - you're going to win in a landslide. Gonna be a landslide. [applause] Because people are tired of lies, they're tired of losing their jobs, they're tired of seeing their companies being ripped out and going to other places. They're tired of China coming in and dropping steel all over the place to put your companies out of business, so we have to go to China to get our steel, which is happening very quickly.  And that's why the steel workers are with me, that's why the miners are with me, that's why the working people, electricians, the plumbers, the sheetrockers, the concrete guys and gals, they're all - they're with us.  And I grew up, you know they say, you know you're really rich, how come you sort of relate to these people? Well, my father built houses and I used to work in these houses and I got to know the electricians, I got to know all these people, I got to know the plumbers, the steamfitters—I got to know them all.  And I liked them better than the rich people that I know. I know a lot of rich people. It's true. They're better. I like them better. So, anyway—and, we are going to put people back to work. We're not playing games. And it's going to go quickly. By the way, it's going to go quickly. But look at this, OK. So, Erie, has lost one in three manufacturing jobs. You know that, all I—you do—I flew over, you're looking at the plants, plants that 25 years ago, 20 years ago, 15 years ago, some two years ago, were vibrant.  But no plant two years ago was too vibrant because it was down to half, down to a quarter, down to a tenth, and then ultimately they closed, but you see them. They are falling over. The rain, the sleet, the snow, the wind. These are great buildings that are falling apart. Don't feel bad, all over the country. Upstate New York is a disaster, which Hillary Clinton said that she was going to fix.  OK, so the Washington Post is extraordinarily dishonest and that's fine. But they wrote a story, I couldn't believe I saw this story, they talked about Hillary Clinton. It was a headline, Hillary Clinton and when she ran for the United States Senator from New York, she said to the people in upstate New York, which was starting to really have problems because of her husband's bill NAFTA.  And companies were leaving, tremendous unemployment, tremendous problems, making nothing and she said I will turn it around, I will create 200,000 jobs, we're going to do a great job. Guess what? She got elected, she did nothing. And the only ones that benefited were the consultants and the people that helped her out. It is a disaster. upstate New York is right now worse than anything you have in the state of Pennsylvania, she did nothing.  And I watched her yesterday, which was hard to do, because she is boring, OK? [applause] I watched her yesterday talking about—you know what's funny? I said I'm going to renegotiate NAFTA and they said what happens if you can't make a deal, I said we're going to terminate, we're getting out. And [applause] So I've been saying that and I've been saying we're going to renegotiate different trade deals, and we're going to make great trade deals and all this and she's never said that. All of a sudden, two days ago, I will renegotiate trade deals. She's not going to do it, folks. She's going to renegotiate trade deals the same way she was going to put 200,000 jobs in upstate New York.  It turned out to be a total fantasy and I have to tell you, I respect the Washington Post for writing one bad story. Because you what they're doing? And Reince was alluding to it a little bit, the only way she gets elected is if they don't report on her. They don't show her. They have me on so much television. There's CNN, you talk about dishonesty, it's called the Clinton—wait—it's called the Clinton News Network, CNN. Now, think of it, Clinton is[applause] She's hardly ever on. So yesterday, they have yesterday, a scandal with the emails, another one. I'm not talking about the 33,000 emails that she deleted or got rid of. Can you imagine what was on those emails? Can you imagine? I love that. Can you imagine what was on those emails, 33,000 emails were deleted. And she said well it had to do with the wedding and yoga.  I give two to yoga, I give five to the wedding. I'll tell you, the lies, the deception. We're running like they run right now a third world country folks, OK? You saw what happened, it's running like a third world country, we're being talked about all over the world, nobody can believe it.  In fact, when they were going over the charges against Hillary Clinton, one after another after another after another, however, and yet other people, their lives have been destroyed for doing much less, all right?  Their lives have been destroyed. So now they have a big scandal in New York. It's in the New York papers, but very little. Pay right? Pay for play. And it's horrifying, it's horrifying. Our government is for sale. Our government is for sale by a crooked person. And what they're doing is they're trying to not talk about her. Take a look. You go to CNN as an example. Story after story about Trump. Story—Trump. Trump. Trump. Trump.  And yesterday, it was announced that people are tired of negative—the hit jobs and CNN's starting to do very poorly. That's good. I like that. I like that. And I have to say, Fox has been treating us fairly. Fox has been fair. But CNN has been catastrophic. It's so dishonest.  But somebody was explaining to me their theory. If they don't report on her, people aren't going to know how bad she is. Look at her news conference. She hasn't had a news conference in like 260 days. That last one wasn't a news conference. That was a few of her friends. They asked her a question. What did she say about the circuit, right? Let me tell you, if I ever said that, short- circuited, if I ever said I short-circuited, it would be headlines all over the world. They would call for the death penalty. [applause] Can you imagine if I said that I short-circuited? I mean, I stand up here for months in front of massive crowds, she gets 300 people going to her events. She gets 300 people and then she reads something from a teleprompter and then she leaves and she goes home and she goes to sleep. [applause] And then she wakes and she goes again. And I'm telling you—and nobody does anything about it. Now me, I stand up here—I'm not looking at notes. I'm not reading teleprompters. Not easy. Not easy. Not easy. [applause] But—but—remember—but—and if I make one mistake [inaudible] say, he mention something wrong. He got a wrong date. It's like headlines all over. She can say she short-circuited up here. I don't want a president who short-circuits. Is that OK? I don't want it. I don't want a president who short-circuits. [applause] We've got to deal with ISIS. We've got to deal with China. We've got to deal with lots of people. They're not short-circuiting. But I don't want somebody that short-circuits. So let me just tell you—let me just tell you.  Over the last little while—you know, every time, it's always a big deal. When I said that Obama—and of course, I'm being sarcastic. And they know that because after I said that, I said he's the MVP, he's going to collect his MVP award. OK.  So I said Obama is the founder of ISIS. The founder. [applause] And these dishonest media people—they're the most dishonest people. They said oh, did he mean that? Didn't he mean that? And after that, I'd say a lot—in fact, they like him so much because he's been so weak and so bad. I mean, he let this happen. They had eight states. They had eight countries. They're now in 28 countries. They're expanding.  So I said the founder of—obviously, I'm being sarcastic. Then—then—but not that sarcastic, to be honest with you. [applause] And they all said, he should not say that. They should call him an enabler. Call him an enabler. He's an enabler. I said, that doesn't sound the same. He's an enabler. People are going to say what's—these people are the worst. But listen, so I said the founder of ISIS. And in fact, very soon he's going over to pick up his most valuable player award. Did I say that? I say it all the time. TRUMP: So they knew I was being sarcastic. By now they're analyzing. Did I really mean that? How could I say that? These people are the lowest form of life. I'm telling you. The lowest. [applause] They are the lowest form of humanity. Not all of them. They have about 25 percent that are pretty good, actually. But most of them. OK. So, here's the story. So Erie has lost a lot. Right? You know that, right? Hang in, don't leave. I promise we can fix it so fast. We will stop these countries from taking our jobs. We will stop these countries from taking our companies. Hold on.  Our jobs will come back. Now, I came up with a great plan. I'm lowering corporate taxes so our companies stay, so I don't even have to make the call. The corporate inversions - you know, we have companies that have, they say, two and a half trillion dollars outside of our comp - they can't get their money back. We don't let them.  Everybody agrees that we should do it. Republicans, Democrats, everybody agrees. What's the - look, why do we not want them to bring money back? You know why? Because we don't have a president that can sit the leaders of both parties around a table and in about five minutes let them say let's bring this money back in so we can work it in this country, right?  That's what it is. So we're going to bring that money back in, we're going to lower taxes, we're going to keep our companies - and if our companies want to leave, they're going to pay a nice big beautiful tax to get their product back in.  OK? That's what's going to happen. So, the existing U.S. trade deficit with TPP participating nations has already cost Pennsylvania 68,000 jobs, folks. No more, folks.  We're not going to be stupid people any more, we're going to be the really, really smart people. It's going to be America first. America first. America first. First. [applause] So, the destruction of manufacturing in Pennsylvania was caused by Hillary Clinton's and her husband's disastrous trade policies. I mean, you take a look at what she's done. At the bidding of her corporate funders, Hillary Clinton has backed every job-killing trade deal for decades. She has received so much money, she has approved virtually every tax increase put before her.  Yesterday - you see 1.3 trillion in tax increases. We're the highest taxed nation in the land, essentially. We're the highest taxed nation in the world. Anywhere in the world.  And of the industrialized nations, we're far and away the highest taxed nation. And she's proposing a massive tax increase. Folks, we can't do it. It's going to make our country non-competitive - it's already non-competitive.  It's going to make our country non-competitive and we're not going to do it. I'm proposing a massive tax decrease for the middle class, for business, and businesses are going to pour in - not since Ronald Reagan has anything like this been proposed.  Businesses instead of leaving because their taxes are so high, they're going to stay. I might not even have to make those calls. Now, if I do, I will, meaning my people will. I'll do some, I love doing it. I would love telling some guy you're not moving. Well, Mr. President, sir, we would like to move to Mexico. You're not moving and if you do you pay the 35 percent tax. You say Well, in that case, I'm not moving, I'm not moving. In that case, I'm not moving. So easy.  So, your coal industry, your steel industry, which has been ravaged, your General Electrics of the world, which have been ravaged, just ravaged, we're going to end it and I'll tell you why. Over the years, I've watched. For years, for 10 years, for 12 years, for 15 years, beyond Obama, and I've watched as politicians talked about stopping countries from leaving - companies from leaving our states. You need strength, is right.  Our states. And I watched. Remember they give the low-interest loans? Here's a low-interest loan if you stay in Pennsylvania, here's a zero-interest loan, you don't have to pay, here's a this, here's tax abatement of any kind you want, we'll help your - it doesn't work, folks, that's not what they need. They have money.  They want to go out, they want to move to another country and because our politicians are so dumb, they want to sell their product to us and not have any retribution, not have any consequences. So all of that's over and I think you understand it and Hillary can't do it. Number one, she can't do it because the mentality isn't there. She can't do it. No, the mentality.  You know, she said fairly recently, I don't like Donald Trump's tone. His tone isn't nice. And I said, here we have a country that's being taken advantage of by every country in the world. Our businesses are being taken. Our jobs being taken. Everything's being taken.  Here we have a world where ISIS is chopping off the heads of Christians and many others, drowning people in steel cages, burying people in the sand, and we have somebody up there who wants to be our president that says, I don't like Donald Trump's tone. [applause] Folks, we better get smart, folks. Hey, look, let's see what happens. We better get smart. We better get smart. [applause] We better get smart. We better get tough. And if we're not smart and we're not tough, we're not going to have a country left. And one of the things I have to talk to you about before I leave is our borders. Illegal immigrants are pouring into our country. In fact, I brought something for you people. I brought—I brought—I had to do this. I didn't want to depress you. OK, look. The Clinton legacy.  Nearly one in three manufacturing jobs in Erie, PA—Erie, PA, sound familiar—have been lost since Clinton allowed a certain deal with China to happen. Now, look at this—look at this chart. This is 2001, not long ago. This is now. Congratulations, folks. I hope you're doing well. OK? I hope you're doing well. I don't want to hurt them. I hope you're doing well.  But you know what? You can't do well. When you have a government that is so stupid, that is so—that is so incompetent, you can't do it. Here's another one, folks. This is what we're talking about. Syrian refugees—we have no idea who they are, where they're coming from, no paperwork. You saw what happened in San Bernardino. You saw what happened—frankly, take a look at all over the world. Take a look at what's happening.  If we don't get smart and we don't get smart fast—Barack Obama is allowing Syrian refugees to come into our country by the thousands. Now, I have as big a heart as anybody in this room and I want to build safe zones and I want, by the way, the Gulf states to pay for it because they've got plenty of money and they're not doing much. OK? We'll supervise it. OPM, other people's money. We'll supervise it, right? We'll supervise it.  But they're going to pay for it because we're protecting these people. If it weren't for the United States, those countries wouldn't even exist. They'd be gone. The power we have is so enormous, but we have people that don't know what they're doing. We have an incompetent president. We have people that don't know what they're doing.  So look at this. Look at this. Syrian refugees admitted to the United States on a monthly basis. Look what's happening. Look what's happening. [booing] Now, in all fairness, we want to help people. Can't take a chance. San Bernardino, they walk in. They start shooting. Paris, the best, the toughest gun laws in the world, Paris, France. They walk in. They kill 130 people. They wound so gravely hundreds of people.  Now, let me just tell you because well—we're on the Second Amendment, right, Second Amendment. If we had in San Bernardino—if we had in San Bernardino or in Orlando or someplace, somebody in that room like this guy right here, right, or that guy with the blue make America great again hat on or the one with the red make America—or that woman with the beautiful blonde hair. I wish I had hair that looked like that. [applause] But if we had somebody and they happened to have a gun, San Bernardino, they see him come in—first of all, if they knew there was a gun where the bullets would be flying in the other direction, they probably wouldn't have got [inaudible] in, OK? But let's assume they did. The carnage would not have been what the carnage was. We have to protect our Second Amendment. Hillary Clinton wants to kill our second amendment. [applause] She wants to kill it. [applause] So here's our chart. And I was thinking about doing a—I bring—every once in a—like, one in ten I do it, you know a lot of these. I love the people. We have such a movement going on. Who likes the snake? Do you know the snake? Do you like it? Who likes the snake? Here we are with this. We know bad things are going to happen. We know as we allow more and more people to come in from these terror areas, bad things are going to happen.  Has anybody heard the snake? Not that many? Should I do it again? So think of this, folks, think of this, think of it. This is what is going on in our country with our borders. And by the way, we're going to have a strong border, we're going to have a wall, it's going to be a powerful wall that Mexico's going to pay for the wall. [applause] And we have no choice, and we have no choice. But think of this. This is now a situation where this was written by Al Wilson many years ago and I read it and I said you know that really pertains to what's happening to the United States and it has to do with being fooled, it has to do with a lot of different things but when you're listening to this, think of our border, think of the people that we're letting in by the thousands and Hillary Clinton, you saw those numbers right? With the chart, it's through the roof.  Hillary Clinton wants to allow 550 percent more coming into our country. How stupid are we? So, are you ready, you ready, you like it, you sure? On her way to work one morning, down the path along the lake, a tender hearted woman saw a poor, half-frozen snake, his pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew. Oh well, she cried, I'll take you in and I'll take care of you.  Take me in, oh tender woman, take me in for heaven's sake, take me in oh tender woman, sighed the broken snake. She wrapped him up, all cozy, in a curvature of silk. Then laid him by the fireside with some honey and some milk. Now she hurried home from work that night. As soon as she arrived, she found that pretty snake she'd taken in, had been revived. Take me in oh tender woman, take me in for heaven's sake.  Take me in oh tender woman, sighed the broken snake. Now she clutched him to her bosom. You're so beautiful, she cried. But if I hadn't brought you in by now, you certainly would have died. Now she stroked his pretty skin and then she kissed and held him tight. But instead of saying thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite. Take me in oh tender woman, take me in for heaven's sake.  Take me in oh tender woman, sighed the vicious snake. I saved you, I saved you, I saved you, cried that woman. And you've bit me, heaven's why. You know your bite is poisonous and now I'm going to die. Oh shut up, silly woman, said the reptile with a grin. You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in. [applause] Get ready folks, get ready. We're led by stupid people. We're led by leaders and you know honestly, I didn't need this. This I didn't need. I had a nice life, built a great company—a great company, some of the great real estate assets of the world. I may never see them. You know if I win, I may never see them again, and I love them—all over the world.  But you know what? This is so important. And I watched what was happening with the Iran deal, and I watched what was happening with jobs, and I watched what was happening with trade where China makes $500 billion in trade deficits with us.  I look and I saw. Take a look at Mexico. You know, the politicians say, you'll never, ever be able to get Mexico to allow you to build a wall. I say trust me. Now, they don't say that anymore. Now they say, they won't put the money up to build a wall. So easy. Mexico—our trade deficit is massive, massive. They make a fortune off the stupidity of the United Stated.  Mexico will 100 percent—you hear—100 percent pay for the wall, 100 percent. [applause] OK? One hundred percent. But the story of the snake is what's happening to our country. We're letting people in. Many of these people hate us. Many of these people don't have good thoughts. And you see what one person can do—one sick wacko can do in Orlando. And then you see his father sitting behind Hillary Clinton with a big smile on his face—with a big, fat smile on his face, right?  And he was wearing a red hat, and I said, I hope that's not one of my hats. It wasn't. I was concerned. I saw that hat. I said, I hope it doesn't say make America great again. Bad guy—bad guy. Horrendous son—horrendous son.  So here's the story, folks. We have to win—we have to win Pennsylvania, so important. So [applause] Hillary Clinton is run by people that do this very professionally. They're very good. They keep her out of the spotlight. She doesn't talk to reporters—very rarely. She doesn't do press conferences. She doesn't expose whatever's going on up here. She doesn't—which isn't good. She doesn't expose her mind to questions. And what they want to do is they want to try and fake it through.  We need strength. We need toughness. We need a strong temperament. We need a strong tone. At the same time—at the same time, let me tell you—at the same time, we need real, big, beautiful heart because we have to straighten out healthcare. Obamacare's going to be repealed and replaced.  It's going to repay—did you see—did you see what's happening with Obamacare? Did you see where the numbers are going up 30, 40, and 50 percent? Wait until you see what happens on November 1st. Now, on November 1st, they're trying to delay it.  But you're going to get increases, the likes of which probably no country, nobody has ever seen. OK? Anybody in the history of healthcare—in Texas, through going through Blue Cross Blue Shield, they just had almost a 50 percent increase in their premiums.  And the deductibles are so high that unless you get hit by one of those General Electric locomotives and you live for like a long time prior to death, you'll never, ever be able to use your healthcare—the healthcare. Because here's what's happened—here's what's happened. The deductible is so high, you never get to use it.  So, you're spending money, your deductibles raises by 17, 18, 19 percent. But now, it's going to go really bad, really bad. It's going to die of its own volition, but we have to kill it first. It's killing our country, it's killing our jobs—it's killing our jobs.  So, here's the story, folks—folks. We have to win Pennsylvania. We have to beat this professional group of people that are running her for her own—for their own purposes. We have to win Pennsylvania. We win Pennsylvania, we're going to win it. You know, we're up in Florida. We're doing well in Ohio. And I'm hearing we're doing well here. We'll find out.  Here's the story... [applause] Here's the story. We have to win the state of Pennsylvania. I went to school here. My kids went to school here. We're going to win Pennsylvania. If we win Pennsylvania, I'll tell you what. We are very much on our way. You know, the Republicans do have a tougher path, just so you—not my fault. Not my fault. It's a tougher path.  For the presidency, it's just a tougher, winding road. But if win Pennsylvania, we win Florida where we're doing really well, I think we can win Ohio, it'll be over. It'll be over. It'll be over. [applause] So, on November 8th, you have to get out and vote or do some balloting, and I don't care—look, here's the story. If you're not feeling well, if you're so sick, if you go to your doctor and he goes, I'm sorry sir, but you've only got a few weeks left. And it's November 1st. And he gives you the ultimate word, not looking good. You haven't got long left. I don't care and nobody else in this room cares. You have to on November 8th get out of bed and get out and vote, right? Get out and vote. [applause] Now, in a lot of cases, you can do your early ballots too. All I'm telling you though—look, folks. I'm just saying your jobs have been taken. Your military and all of the other things, we're going to save your Second Amendment, which is protection, we're going to get of Common Core, you're going to bring your education locally. [applause] All things—I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare. All these things. We're going to take care of our vets. But here's the story, folks. For you people in particular because you have been devastated.  Supreme Court, he said. Yes. Yes. Thank you. Who did that? Who said that? Thank you. By the way, and I have to just stop for a second. Look, Supreme Court Justice Scalia great. Was supposed to live for a long time. He died. So you have already an empty. This next president could have the most Supreme Court nominations of any president. Could take more justices than—it could be up to five. Probably going to be three, could be four, could be five. OK?  If Hillary Clinton gets to put hard-leaning left judges on the Supreme Court, number one, your Second Amendment will be gone. Our country will never ever be the same. We will have problems like we've never had before and you won't have—you will have a whole different deal going, which we don't want, believe me.  So, here's the story. If for no other reason, I am going to put—and you know, I've picked through Federalist society—we picked 11 Supreme Court justices. We're going to add probably four more, all vetted through Federalists, through Heritage, highly—I actually got very good marks. We're going to pick these people or people very like that.  So, here's the story, here's the story. You ready? We don't win anymore, you people don't win, that's for sure. You just have to look at the statistics for jobs. We're going to start winning again. We're going to win so much that you're going to get sick and tired of winning.  You're going to say Mr. President—you're going to send the congressman to see me in Washington. He's going to say, Mr. President, we have to do something. The people of Pennsylvania, and in particular our friends in Erie, they're sick and tired of winning. They can't stand winning so much. Mr. President, we just don't want to win that much. We really want to give other nations like it used to be, where it's good for them and bad for us, at least a little bit.  And I'm going to say—I'm going to say, Mr. Congressman, I don't think you know your people very well, they want to win. And we want to win. And you want to win. And we're going to win. We're going to win so much. We're going to win with our military, we're going to knock the hell out of ISIS. [applause] We're going to win for our vets. We're going to take of our vets. We're going to win at the border, we're going to build a wall, we're going to have Mexico pay, believe me 100 percent. We're going to win with education. We're going to win for our Second Amendment. We're going to win on all of the things we discussed. We're going to win again and you're going to be proud of your country again.  We're not going to be the people that are laughed at all over the world for not knowing what we're doing, for allowing others to come in and just strip us of what we have. [applause] We are going to win. We are going to be America first. [applause] We are going to make America great again. And it's going to happen quickly. [applause] Thank you everybody, thank you. [applause]
t16.txt:Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. What a crowd. Wow, look at that. Boy. What a crowd. [applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. We just set a record in this building, folks, so that's good news. That's fantastic. Thank you. [applause] I love Michigan, and I must tell you, come November, to be specific, November 8th, with your help, we are going to win and we are going to win big. [applause] And we are going to the White House and we are going to bring jobs back to our country and we are going to bring jobs back to Michigan. [applause] It's going to be a victory for the people, a victory for the wage-earner, the factory worker. Remember this, a big, big victory for the factory worker. They haven't had those victories for a long time. A victory for every citizen and for all of the people whose voices have not been heard for many, many years. They're going to be heard again. [applause] It'll be a win for the voters, not for the pundits, not for the journalists, not for the lobbyists, not for the global special interests funding my opponent's campaign. [booing] It's going to be your victory. [applause] These are hard times for many in this country. I just got back from a tour of the suffering and devastation in Louisiana. Perhaps you can tell by the way I'm dressed. Just got off the plane. It was actually incredible. The spirit of the people is incredible. The devastation, likewise, they've never seen anything like it, but the spirit of the people is incredible. And honestly, Obama ought to get off the golf course and get down there. [applause] We mourn for the lives lost and we pledge our help, comfort and support to every last person in need. To the people of Louisiana, we are with you and we will always be with you. [applause] In my vision, I saw not only the suffering of our people but also their strength, courage and really unbeatable spirit. Their spirit will overcome. We have a lot to overcome in our country, especially the fact that our jobs are being taken away from us and going to other lands, and we're not going to allow it to happen, and especially it's happening right here in Michigan. [applause] It's an amazing spirit that we will need to rebuild our country. It's that strength that we're going to need to create the new American future our children so much deserve. [applause] In this new -- thank you. Thank you very much. In this new future, millions of workers on the sidelines will be returned to the work force. And if I'm not elected president, that will never happen, believe me. They're talking to you, they're playing you, but believe me, you know the answer.  And I have to say that I've been talking about Michigan and the car industry and how your businesses and plants have been ripped out of your land, and I have been doing it for four years to the people of Michigan. Other people started talking about it last week. They're not going to do anything about it.  Crumbling roads, bridges and airports will be replaced with the infrastructure our country needs and deserves. [applause] Families strapped in welfare will be provided with jobs and opportunity. Children stuck in failing government schools will be able to attend the school of their choice. [applause] Government will become lean, effective, responsible and honest. [applause] Our border will be protected and our children will be safe, very, very safe. [applause] And we will build the wall, don't worry about it. We will build the wall. [applause] Law and order will be restored and the poorest places in our country will know safety and peace again. [applause] American values and cultures will be cherished - and I mean cherished and celebrated once again. But to achieve this new American future, we must break free from the bitter failures of the past, and reject the same insiders telling us the same old lies over and over, and over again. [applause] No group in America has been more harmed by Hillary Clinton's policies than African-Americans no group. No group. If Hillary Clinton's goal was to inflict pain on the African-American community, she could not have done a better job. It is a disgrace. [applause] Tonight I'm asking for the vote of every single African-American citizen in this country who wants to see a better future. [applause] The inner cities of our country have been run by the Democratic party for more than 50 years. Their policies have produced only poverty, joblessness, failing schools, and broken homes. It's time to hold democratic politicians accountable for what they have done to these communities. At what point do we say enough? [applause] At what point do we say enough? [applause] It is time to hold failed leaders accountable for their results, not just their empty words over and over again. Look at what the democratic party has done to the city as an example and there are many others, of Detroit. 40 percent of Detroit's residents, 40 percent, live in poverty. Half of all Detroit residents do not work, and cannot work, and can't get a job Detroit tops the list of most dangerous cities in terms of violent crime, number one. This is the legacy of the democratic politicians who have run this city. This is the result of the policy agenda embraced by crooked Hillary Clinton. [booing] 33,000 e-mails gone. [booing] The only way to change results is to change leadership. [applause] We can never fix our problems by relying on the same politicians who created our problems in the first place. A new future requires brand new leadership. [applause] Look at how much African-American communities are suffering from democratic control. To those I say the following, what do you have to lose by trying something new like Trump? What do you have to lose? [applause] I say it again, what do you have to lose? Look, you're living in poverty. Your schools are no good. You have no jobs. 58% of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose? And at the end of four years, I guarantee you that I will get over 95% of the African American vote. I promise you. Because I will produce, I will produce for the inner cities and I will produce for the African Americans. And the Democrats will not produce and all they have done is taken advantage of your vote. That's all they've done. And once the election is over, they go back to their palaces in Washington. And you know what? They do nothing for you. Just remember it. So, you have nothing to lose. One thing we know for sure: if you keep voting for the same people you will keep getting the same, exactly the same, results.  My administration will go to work for you as no one has ever done before. We will work. We will bring back jobs. We will work. By contrast, the one thing every item in Hillary Clinton's agenda has in common is that it takes jobs and opportunities away from African American workers. It takes jobs away from all workers because your companies are leaving Michigan. Your companies are leaving every single state in our union. They're going to Mexico. They're going everywhere but here.  Hillary Clinton supports open borders. Which means many things but it means people pouring and they take your jobs. Whether you like it or don't like it. They take your jobs.  Her fierce opposition to school choice. You need choice. You have to get your children into good schools. You do that through competition. You need choice.  Her plan to massively raise taxes on small business and everyone. $1.3 trillion tax increase. Where as I am cutting taxes very substantively for business and for the middle class.  Her tremendous opposition to American energy. Her opposition is fierce and her record of giving our jobs away to many many other countries. America must reject the bigot dream of Hillary Clinton who sees communities of color only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future.  Hillary Clinton would rather provide a job to a refugee from overseas that to give that job to unemployed African American youth in cities like Detroit, who have become refugees in their own country.  It's time to get our country back to work and that includes an all out effort. To help young African Americans get the good paying jobs that they deserve. Hillary Clinton's plan would bring in an estimated 620,000 refugees in her first term at a lifetime benefit cost of some $400 billion to our country. According to the Senate Immigration Subcommittee. Hillary Clinton wants to be America's Angela Merkel. By the way, for the price of supporting one refugee in the United States, we could support 12 in a safe zone in the Middle East or let's say Syria.  The approved refugee screening standards that I have proposed will save countless, billions of dollars. It's called extreme vetting. Extreme vetting. [applause] We will invest a portion of the money saved in the jobs program for inner city youth. The African American community has given so much to this country. They fought and died in every war since the Revolution.  They've lifted up the conscience of our nation in the long march towards civil rights. They've sacrificed so much for the national good. Yet, nearly 4 in 10 African Americans children still live in poverty and 58%, as I said, of African Americans are not working.  They cannot find a job. We must do better as a country. I refuse to believe that the future must be like the past. It won't be. Our future will be a great future for everyone. For everyone. [applause] In a Trump administration, all workers of all colors will get priorities for jobs in their own country which is about time. I want higher wages for African Americans, for Hispanic Americans, and for all Americans. We want higher wages [applause] Many, many workers in our country are making substantially less money today in real wages than they made 18 years ago.  They're working two jobs instead of one. They're working much harder as they get older and it's supposed to be the opposite. We're gonna stop it. We're going to create great jobs and we're gonna get the wages up.  Hillary Clinton, is a throwback to an ugly past where politicians preyed on our poorest citizens while selling them out for personal gain. Promises, promises, all talk no action. All talk, no action politicians.  They talk, talk, talk. You vote them in with great fan fare and then they just do nothing.  With Trump, that is not going to happen. Believe me.  We must turn the page on yesterday, only a change in leadership will produce a change in outcomes. And we can't take, as a country, four more years of Obama. And that's what you get with Hillary Clinton but probably worse.  In this new American future, American workers will always come first. America first, always come first.  This will include a complete revitalization of the Michigan manufacturing sector. Now, you have to understand, the Michigan manufacturing sector is a disaster. Is a disaster. Look at your notes, look at your stats, look at what's happening to your state. You're losing your businesses. It's like taking candy away from a baby. And many people right now in this audience that think you have jobs, you're gonna find out very soon that your company is leaving from Mexico or some other place and you're not going to have your job for very long. And if Trump gets in, those days are over folks, they're over [applause] We will be brining back our jobs to Michigan. There will be a very big price to pay for those companies that wanna leave our land, go someplace else, manufacture their goods, and sell back with no retribution. It won't happen. There will be consequence. Won't happen. It will not happen.  Michigan lost more than 1 in 4 of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA.  As you know, NAFTA, one of the worst trade bills in history maybe, maybe the worst trade bill signed in the history of the world. Not only in our country. Its emptied out Michigan, its emptied out New England. Its emptied out New York State. Its emptied out so many of our great companies. They leave and they fire. We end up with devastation. We end up with unemployment. We end up with nothing. The bill was signed by Bill Clinton. [booing] It was supported by Hillary Clinton. [booing]  Right here in this community, you have lost 1 in 7 manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton put China into the World Trade Organization. Another Hillary Clinton back deal. She backs all the deals. And by the way, she will be backing Trans Pacific Partnership. TPP. If she is elected. Just mark your words. Just remember, you know it's gonna happen. She considered it the gold standard. All of a sudden when she heard me talking about it, she said "I can't win this one" so she went against it. She will go back immediately, and you saw that when the governor of Virginia, who's her friend, said that was going to happen. Detroit lost more than 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs following the NAFTA and WTO agreements. That was supported very strongly by my opponent. No industry, has been hurt more by Hillary Clinton's policies than the automobile industry or as we call it the car industry. It has been a total disaster.  According to the Bureau of the Labor of Statistics, before NAFTA went into effect, there were 285,000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is down to only 160,000 and it is going to be a lot lower because if you look at the massive plants being built right now in Mexico, car plants, folks, you can kiss these jobs goodbye. [booing] But not me. Not with me. It won't happen. [applause] In 2014, General Motors announced plans to double its investments in Mexico by plans by 2018. Not good. [booing] In April 2016, Ford Motor Company announced plans to invest another $1.6 billion constructing an auto plant in Mexico. Mexico will become the car capital of the world very, very quickly. And Michigan is going to end up with lots of empty buildings all over the place unless you elect Donald Trump president. In which case, it's not gonna happen. [applause] In same month, Fiat Chrysler announced 1,300 layoffs. The list goes on and on. We will turn it around, we will turn it around fast. We will meet with these companies and we will say, it will not be easy for you to move your plant to Mexico for you sell your cars through what will be a very strong border, and for you not to pay tax on those cars coming in, okay? [applause] And when we tell them that there will be a substantial tax on the cars that they make in Mexico and other places, number one, they're not going to move in the first place, and number two, if they do, our country will make one heck of a lot of money. [applause]	 But to save your jobs and do all of the things that I'm talking about, we have to win on November 8th. [applause] The destruction that NAFTA started will be finished off if the Transpacific Partnership is approved. It will be almost, nothing is as bad as NAFTA, but it will be almost as bad as NAFTA.  We know from Hillary's closest friend, that she is planning to ram through TPP if she's elected. She even called it, as I said, the gold standard. Its passage would be a disaster for Michigan, in particular, for the car industry in particular, for the people of Michigan. I won't let it happen. [applause] According to the Economic Policy Institute, the United States trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost over one million manufacturing jobs in our country in 2015. By far the biggest losses occurred in motor vehicles and parks, which lost nearly 740,000 think of that 740,000 manufacturing jobs. Michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of state workforce due to trade deficit with TPP members.  Just imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if Hillary gets her wish and approves TPP. It will not be pretty. That's why I have announced that we will withdrawal from the deal before that deal can ever, ever, ever happen. [applause] I have have previously laid out a detailed seven-point plan for trade reform, available on my website. It includes strong protections against currency manipulation from countries like China and tariffs against any nation that cheats by unfairly subsidizing their goods, of which many of them do. [applause] My plan also includes a total renegotiation of NAFTA so our jobs can come back. [applause] And if we can't make a much, much better deal than we have right now, we will walk. [applause] I'm not in any way, shape or form an isolationist. I don't believe in it, but we have to make great deals for our country. We're losing in our whole trade negotiation with all countries over $800 billion a year. That's our trade deficit. Who negotiates these deals? We want great trade deals and we will have them. [applause] But we want trade deals that work for America, that create jobs and wealth for our country, that work for the American worker. [applause] We want to shrink our almost $800 billion trade deficit. We don't want to expand it, and it's been expanding for years. For years and years. You look at the charts up, up, up, up, up. And I say to myself so often, why don't they do something about it? And the reason is we have political hacks as our negotiators.  We have politicians as our negotiators. We have politicians that are controlled like Hillary Clinton by her donors, her special interests and her lobbyists and they won't let her do what's right for our workers and for our country.  We want to be leading the world in production, exports and manufacturing. We want jobs to leave from other countries and come into our country for a change. [applause] Another major issue in this race is foreign policy. Hillary Clinton has made one bad foreign policy decision after another. Beginning with the support for going to war in Iraq, and I opposed it so strongly.  Nobody cared. I was a civilian, but I opposed it. I said you will have a total destabilization of the Middle East. It was such common sense and look what happened. Her tenure as secretary of State may be regarded as the most disastrous in United States history. But she is totally without remorse. Her failed decisions as secretary of State unleashed ISIS onto the world. [booing] But has she ever apologized for the death and destruction she has caused? No. Look at the world before and after she became Secretary of State. Pre-Hillary in the early 2009s, Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence. Libya was somewhat stable. Syria was under control. The group we now know today, ISIS, was close to being extinguished. Iran was being choked by sanctions.  Now, take a look at what we have. Fast forward to the present time. After Hillary, here is what it looks like. Iraq is in total chaos. Syria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war. A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States, where we're taking in thousands and thousands and thousands of people. ISIS has been unleashed unto the entire world.  Iran, the world's top state sponsor of terrorism has been put on the path to nuclear weapons, was given $400 million in ransom payment cash [booing] Very much like you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan, Obamacare a total disaster. It will be repealed. It will be replaced. [applause] Hillary Clinton is a legacy of death, destruction, and terrorism. America deserves a better legacy. All of you deserve a much, much, better future. I am the change agent. I am the change agent. [applause] I am your messenger. And I said it many times, I'm nothing more than your messenger. It's a message of strong defense, common sense, take care of our vets, great education, get rid of Common Core, great health care, get rid of Obamacare, save our Second Amendment. [applause] Which is under tremendous siege right now. Hillary Clinton is the defender of the status quo or what we have. While our country lost badly under Hillary Clinton, she cashed in big time. Our country was losing. Our people were losing, but she is cashing in.  Bill Clinton's speaking fees surged while Hillary was Secretary of State. He was paid almost $50 million for speeches during her tenure, an increase in 44 percent over the previous four years.  By the way, things came out today that blow everything away today. Then there was all of the money funneled into the Clinton Foundation from foreign governments and corporations. It was pay for play. [booing] Yet, Hillary Clinton, who is indifferent to the suffering she has caused, has no remorse at all. She offers no apologies. No apologies for unleashing ISIS. No apologies for her open borders. No apologies for lying about her e-mails or about Benghazi. [booing] The only way to learn the full depth of her public corruption is to read the 33,000 e-mails that she deleted.  And the only way to get justice in this rigged system is to show up and vote on November 8th and vote big, big, big. [applause] And I will bring your jobs back. So are you ready to vote? And what about your future? Is it going to be great, good, or terrible? Great. So if you're ready to vote for honest government and the honest government that you deserve, a Trump administration will end the corruption and restore integrity to government service. Remember, I'm funding my campaign, I'm spending tremendous amounts of money on running for office.  I'm raising money for the Republican Party and the Republican National Committee, which I think is doing a very good job, but I'll tell you more about that on November 8th. I'll let you know if they do a good job or if they do not such a good job. But I think they're going to do a great job.  No one will be above the law in a Trump administration. The State Department will work for the country, not for Hillary Clinton's donors. [applause] And I will work for you and I will work for no one else. I will work for you. I will never lie to you. I will never put any other interests before you and I will never, ever stop fighting for you. Never. [applause] The government will work for the people again. That means we are only going to admit individuals into our country who support our values and we're not going to issue visas where adequate screening controls take place. We are going to make sure that we have total screening, and without it, we cannot continue to have our government run like this. We will also seek to join in partnership with any nation that wishes to join us in defeating and destroying ISIS. [applause] At home, taxes will go down, especially for look, I mean, it's going to go down for a lot of people, for business they're going down, businesses are going to flourish, they're going to come pouring back. But taxes will go down, especially for middle-income Americans. [applause] And small business rates will be lowered to 15 percent so we can put millions of new jobs into our poorest neighborhoods. [applause] As I said, Obamacare will be repealed and replaced. Voters, not special interests, will be in charge finally. We are going to bring our country together again. We have a divided country. It's totally divided. The era of division will be replaced with a future of unity, total unity. We will love each other. We will have one county. Everybody will work together. [applause] We are going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common as Americans. It's time to break with the failures of the past and to fight for every last child in this country to have the better future they deserve. [applause] In my administration, every American will be treated equally, protected equally and honored equally. We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American people. [applause] This is the change I am promising to all of you; an honest government with low taxes, a thriving economy and a just society for each and every American. It's time to vote for a new American future. [applause] Together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America united again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again and we will make America great again. God bless you. [applause] Thank you. Thank you very much, Michigan. Thank you.
t18.txt:Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much. [applause] Senator, Governor and Rudy, thank you very much. Wow, what a group! What a group! Very excited, very, very excited to be with you tonight. Thank you very much. [applause] The people of Jackson and the state of Mississippi have such incredible energy, that very powerful word "energy," unbelievable, incredible energy and spirit, folks. Thank you very much.  And thank you for all the support you've given me right from the beginning. I will not forget it, Mississippi. We love Mississippi right from the beginning, right from the beginning. [applause] This is the spirit we need to rebuild our country a hundred percent. [applause] And this is our chance to break free from the bitter failures of the past and to create a new American future. [applause] To everyone watching across our nation right now, to everyone who has been let down by our terrible, terrible politicians, I am asking for your vote on November 8th. [applause] This is your chance to remove the special interests from their throne of power and to once again have a government of, by and for the people. [applause] No one will be left behind anymore. [applause] I'd like to take this moment to send our thoughts and prayers to everyone at the American University in Kabul, Afghanistan. They are going through a lot.  We must defeat radical Islamic terrorism! [applause] Anyone who will not name our enemy is not fit to lead our country. [applause] Eight years of Obama/Clinton policies have sacrificed our safety and undermined our freedom and independence. Our jobs have moved to other countries. Islamic terrorism has spread within our shores. And an open border has crushed low-income workers and threatened, and I mean totally threatened, our security. [applause] The issues we face here in America are similar to the issues faced in Britain during their referendum on membership in the European Union. This is the movement known as Brexit.  On June 23rd, the people of Britain voted to declare their independence, which is what we're looking to do also, folks [applause] From their international government which hasn't worked. They voted to break away from rule by large corporations and media executives who believe in a world without borders. [booing] They voted to reclaim control over immigration, over their economy, over their government. [booing] Working people and the great people of the U.K. took control of their destiny. [applause] The people profiting from the rigged system, and it is rigged, we're finding it out every single day, the multinational banks, the media celebrities, the big donors tried to scare the British people out of voting for change. The same thing is happening right here in the United States. It's happening.  All the people benefiting from our rigged system don't want things to change. They want you to believe things can't be changed. And they can so easily, so easily and so smartly. And we all know things have to change. We have no choice. And they have to change right now. [applause] Before the vote, I said that Britain would leave the EU, sometimes referred to as European Union, and I said it and I took a lot of heat when I said it. People said, what does he know, what does he know? And guess what? I was very supportive of their right to do it and to take control of their own future, like exactly what we're going to be voting for on November 8th. [applause] Hillary Clinton, who has been on the wrong side of history in every major decision, she's only made bad decisions, she's got bad judgment, she doesn't know what she's doing, folks. [booing] She got this one wrong, too. She got this one wrong, too, folks. She got this one wrong, too. She gets them all wrong. She gets them all wrong, doesn't she? She really got the e-mails wrong, that I can tell you. [laughter] And now Hillary wants to surrender America to globalism, just what we don't want. [booing] She wants a country without borders. She wants trade deals written for the benefit of foreign corporations. She wants a government that ignores the will of the people. [booing] She wants to sell out American security to the Clinton Foundation for a big, fat pile of cash. [booing] It's hard to tell where the Clinton Foundation ends and where the State Department begins. According to the Associated Press, more than half the meetings she took as secretary of state with people outside government were with foundation donors. [booing] Hillary Clinton does not believe in America first. We believe in America first. [applause] Hillary believes in donors first and special interests and lobbyists. She will never straighten out our country. She doesn't have the strength, the stamina or the ability to straighten out our country. We'll have four more years of Obama and that's just what we don't want. [booing] She would rather give a job to a refugee from overseas than an unemployed American veteran or to an unemployed African American or Hispanic. [booing] The job of a public official is to serve and protect the citizens of the United States [applause] Not illegal immigrants, not foreign nationals seeking entry, but the people living here lawfully today, including millions of African-American and Hispanic citizens, millions, millions being treated very, very unfairly, I can tell you that.  My focus will always be on the well-being of more than 300 million American citizens who call this country home and who love their country. [applause] I will fight for their security. I will fight for their jobs. We will not let jobs be taken out of our country, be ripped out of our country and moved to Mexico and many other countries. We will not let it happen anymore. [applause] We'll be fighting for their jobs and we'll be fighting for your families, that I can tell you. It ends. What's been going on ends on November 8th. [applause] We will have one American nation, not divided, we will be together. Hillary Clinton has betrayed her duty to the people. November 8th is our chance to re-declare American independence. [applause] This is a great honor for me. I am going right now to invite onto the stage the man behind Brexit and a man who led brilliantly the United Kingdom Independence Party in this fight and won despite all odds, despite horrible name-calling, despite so many obstacles.  Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Nigel Farage. [applause] Nigel Farage: "Well, Thank you very much  Good evening Mississippi. [applause]  I come to you from the United Kingdom with a message of hope and a message of optimism. It's a message that says if the little people, if the real people, if the ordinary decent people are prepared to stand up and fight for what they believe in we can overcome the big banks, we can overcome the multinationals. [applause]  And we did it. We made June the 23rd our independence day. [applause]  When we smashed the establishment. And we did it. Everybody said we would lose but what did we see? We saw experts from all over the world. We saw the international monetary fund. We saw Moody's. We saw Standard and Poor's. We saw global leaders project fear.  Telling us that if we voted not to be run by a bunch of unelected old men in Brussels. [applause]  Yeah, well it's okay, they don't like me either so it doesn't really matter does it? [applause]  But they told us our economy would fall off of a cliff. They told us there'd be mass unemployment. They told us that investment would leave our country. And David Cameron, then our Prime Minister, but no longer, told us that we might even get World War III.  And we saw the comentariate and we saw the polling industry doing everything they could to demoralize our campaign. On the day of the vote itself, that morning, they put us ten points behind. And actually, they were all wrong. And they were wrong because what the Brexit campaign did is we reached those people who've been let down by modern global corporatism.  We reached those people. We reached those people who have never voted in their lives, but believe by going out and voting for Brexit they can take back control of their country, take back control of their borders, and get back their pride and self respect. Now, the big card, the big card the Prime Minister decided to play in the referendum was he got a foreign visitor to come to London. to talk to us.  Yes, we were visited by one Barack Obama. And he talked down to us. He treated us as if we were nothing. One of the oldest functioning democracies in the world. And here he was told us to vote remain.  So I, having criticized, having criticized and condemned his behavior, I could not possibly tell you how you should vote in this election, but, but, you know I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I'm hearing you, but I will say this, if I was an American citizen, I wouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton if you paid me.  In fact, I wouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton if she paid me.  Folks, the message is clear. The parallels are there.  There are millions of ordinary Americans who have been let down, who've had a bad time, who feel the political class in Washington are detached from them, who feel so many of their representatives are politically correct parts of that liberal media elite.  They feel people aren't standing up for them and they've actually, in many cases, given up on the whole electoral process. And I think, I think that you have a fantastic opportunity here with this campaign.  You can go out, you can beat the pollsters, you can beat the commentators, you can beat Washington. And you'll do it by doing what we did for Brexit in Britain.  We had our own people's army of ordinary citizens who went out and delivered leaflets, who went to meet people where they worked and where they socialized, who convinced and inspired people to go out if this was the one and only time in their life, and to vote for change.  So my advice to you, if you want change in this country, you better get your walking boots on, you better get out there campaigning and remember, and remember, anything is possible if enough decent people are prepared to stand up against the establishment.  Thank you very much, indeed." Wow! Thank you, Nigel. What a job! What a job he did. What a job he did against all odds. Thank you, Nigel. That was some job that he did against all odds. Everybody said it couldn't be done. And by the way, it's looking like a very wise decision right now by the voters, so I really congratulate Nigel and I thank you for being here. Thank you. [applause] And if I may, we had some tremendous polls come out today. I won't bring it up, I refuse to mention it, but they were very good. We're leading in a lot of locations. [applause] Thank you. It's time for America to recapture, like you just heard, to recapture our destiny. Our government leaders and our media have totally lost touch with the people. They have, they have totally lost touch.  You need no better evidence of that then the fact that the media ignores the plight of Americans who have lost their children to illegal immigrants, but spends day after day pushing for amnesty for those here in total violation of the law. We can't allow that. [booing] Why do our leaders spend so much time talking about how to help people here illegally, they're here illegally, and they spend and they work and they try so hard to help them, but they don't try helping American citizens, some of whom have been devastated by what's happened to their children and their families? Devastated.  jobs, wages and security for Americans. [applause] And the immigration policy I support as president must pass these three tests. First, it must improve jobs and wages for United States citizens. [applause] We have people in this room who were making more money in real wages 18 years ago, were not working as hard as they're working now and they've gotten older, not supposed to be that way, and in many cases and largely because of the disaster known as "Obamacare" they have to hold two jobs, not one, but two jobs and, in some cases, three jobs.  Not going to happen, folks, not going to happen. Second, it must improve the safety and security for United States citizens. [applause] Third, it must improve the quality of life for U.S. citizens. The quality of life, our quality of life is going down. Our level of security, you look back years, you're more insecure now in terms of security than you were 10, 15 and 20 years ago. Hillary Clinton's radical immigration plan fails these tests and it fails them very, very badly. Her push for open borders will lower the wages and kill the jobs of lawful American residents. [booing] Her support for catch-and-release will put innocent American lives at risk and already has, just like President Obama released the illegal immigrant at the border who then killed magnificent, magnificent Sarah Root.  Yesterday I met with her mom, Michelle. Hillary Clinton only talks about the separation of families who choose to come here illegally. I want to focus on the American families who have been permanently separated from their children because of the sanctuary cities and open borders that Hillary Clinton so strongly supports. [booing] Where is the sanctuary for American children? Where is that sanctuary? The dreamers we never talk about are the young Americans. Why aren't young Americans dreamers also? I want my dreamers to be young Americans. [applause] Hillary Clinton also wants to push to bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term [booing] A large number of whom come from large countries where women and gays are horribly brutalized, which will weaken our tolerant way of life. I only want to bring people to our country who share our values and love our people and are capable of loving America. [applause] Importantly, I will also create millions and millions of jobs for our people. [applause] We are going to cut taxes, reduce regulations, fix our trade deals, unleash American energy and repeal and replace the horror show known as "Obamacare." [applause] We are going to create jobs, jobs, jobs! [applause] I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created, believe me. [applause] So we're going to have millions and millions of jobs, jobs like you have never seen in this country before, because our jobs are being stolen from us, our companies are being stolen from us, our manufacturing is down by 40 percent and 50 percent and numbers that nobody even believes. Those days will be over if Donald Trump is elected president of the United States, believe me. [applause] Rising incomes, higher wages, thousands of new companies all across this nation, they'll come in and they'll form. We are going to renegotiate the worst trade deal ever made, not only in this country, but anywhere in the world, known as NAFTA and signed by Bill Clinton. [booing] We're going to stand up to China on trade. We're going to keep out of what will be a disastrous trade deal, Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP. [booing] It will not happen with me. It will absolutely happen with crooked Hillary, believe me. This state has lost more than 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA, and it's lost one in four manufacturing jobs since he put China into the World Trade Organization, both deals supported by Hillary Clinton. Horrible deals, destructive deals, what those deals have done to our jobs and to our country.  We are going to bring back jobs to Mississippi [applause] And in North Carolina, which has treated me so well, and Ohio and to Michigan where our auto plants are leaving and leaving and leaving and going to Mexico and other places, and to Pennsylvania, where I went to school, and to Maryland and all across this land. We're going to bring our jobs back and we're not going to let our jobs be taken away. [applause] Thank you. Thank you. And I'm going to make it my personal mission to bring opportunity, safety and prosperity to our very, very troubled inner cities. [applause] The Democratic Party has failed and betrayed the African-American community. [booing] Democratic crime policies, education policies and economic policies have produced only more crime, more broken homes and more poverty than we've ever had in those communities before. [booing] Nearly four in 10 African-American children live in poverty. Fifty-eight percent of African-American youth are not working. More than 2,700 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of this year alone. [booing] Violent crime has risen 17 percent, and in America's 50 largest cities it's only going one way, folks, and that's up. Homicides are up nearly 50 percent in Washington, D.C. and more than 60 percent from last year in Baltimore.  The Democratic Party has taken the votes of African Americans totally for granted, and they've done nothing in return. [booing] They've just assumed they'll get your support and they've done nothing, absolutely nothing to deserve it. It's time to give the Democrats some competition for African- American votes and for Hispanic votes. [applause] It's time to rebuild the inner cities of America and do it properly. It's time to reject the failed leadership of a rigged political system. And I was the first to use that term, it's a rigged, disgusting system. [applause] To those hurting and suffering and left behind, I say, what do you have to lose by trying something new? What do you have to lose by voting for Donald Trump for president? What do you have to lose? I will fix the problem. I will fix the problem. [applause] If you keep voting for the same people, you will keep getting the same horrible results. But I also want to talk about what you have to gain, right? Right? What do you have to gain? We will create school choice and allow charter schools to absolutely thrive. [applause] What else will we gain? We will empower young Americans to pursue their dreams of opening a small business and make it easier for them to get the credit that they need. [applause] We will renegotiate our horrible trade deals to bring back jobs and opportunity. And the African-American community and the Hispanic community will be our biggest beneficiary of that. [applause] We will lower taxes and unleash job creation and we will tap into trillions of dollars in new energy wealth that we never even knew we had before. [applause] We will protect your jobs from illegal immigration and broken visa programs. And we will rebuild the roads, the bridges, the infrastructure, the tunnels, the airports in your communities and we will rebuild it with our companies, with our steel and with our labor. [applause] Hillary Clinton is a bigot who sees people of color [applause] only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future. She's going to do nothing for African Americans. She's going to do nothing for the Hispanics. She's only going to take care of herself, her husband, her consultants, her donors. These are the people she cares about. She doesn't care what her policies have done to your communities. She doesn't care.  Remember this. You've had her policies, Democrats running some of the inner cities for 50, 70, 80, even over a hundred years. And look what you have right now, poverty, no education, crime, you can't walk down the street with your child. We're going to fix it, we're going to fix it. [applause] Hillary Clinton has no remorse. I will fight to create a better future for every American. The hedge fund managers and Wall Street donors are throwing money at Hillary Clinton to try and stop our change agenda.  Of course, if they start looking at the polls they may stop doing that. [applause] They're going to have to start studying those polls. That's why you need to come out and you have to vote, you have to vote. [applause] That is why you must make your voice heard on November 8th, have to do it. [applause] Another crucial issue in this race is national security. Hillary Clinton may go down as the worst secretary of state that has ever served in that office. [booing] Let's look back at the Middle East at the very beginning of 2009 before the Obama/Clinton administration, that I call a catastrophe, took over. Libya was stable. Syria was under control. Iraq was experiencing a reduction in violence. The group that would become what we now call ISIS was close to being extinguished, would never have happened. Iran was being choked off by economic sanctions.  Fast forward to today. After spending $4 trillion, maybe $5 trillion, nobody even knows how much money has been sucked out of our country, what have the decisions of Obama/Clinton produced?  Libya is in ruins. Our ambassador and three other brave Americans are dead. And ISIS has gained a new base of operations, they're all over the world  Syria is in the midst of a totally disastrous civil war. ISIS controls large portions of the territory. A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and is threatening the United States because Hillary is allowing these people to pour into our country and we don't know who they are, where they come from. We know nothing. Iraq is in chaos and ISIS is on the loose. ISIS has spread across the Middle East and into the west. At the same time, ISIS is trying to infiltrate refugee flows into Europe and definitely folks, definitely, I have been very good at predicting, definitely to the United States. [booing] Iran has become the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, is now flush with up to $150 billion in cash released by the United States, plus another $400 million in cash, cash, cash ransom [booing] That President Obama said had nothing to do with ransom, had nothing to do with the hostages, and his own people said he was wrong. [booing] He lied. He lied. Just like he said Obamacare, "keep your plan, you'll keep your doctor," 28 times, "keep your plan, keep your doctor." And because of that lie, Democrats that would have never passed it passed it and now they regret that they passed it because it is a total disaster. [booing] Worst of all, the nuclear deal puts Iran, the number-one state sponsor of radical Islamic terrorism, on a path to nuclear weapons. In short, the Obama/Clinton foreign policy has unleashed ISIS, destabilized the Middle East and put the nation of Iran, which chants, constantly chants "death to America" in a dominant position of regional power and in fact aspiring to be a dominant world power. And we put them there over the last three years! [booing] This is the legacy of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism and weakness. [booing] But Hillary Clinton's legacy does not have to be America's legacy. We're going to end the era of nation-building, a disastrous concept, a disastrous era, and create new foreign policy joined by our partners in the Middle East that is focused completely on destroying ISIS. We have no choice destroying ISIS. [applause] We will extend a hand of friendship to any nation that will work with us in good faith on this vital mission. I have a message for the terrorists trying to kill our people, our citizens, trying to hurt the world, but trying to hurt the United States: We will find you, we will destroy you and we will win! [applause] Thank you. Thank you. This is not only a military fight, but it will also require cyber warfare and financial warfare. It's also an ideological fight. We will confront directly the hateful, it's just so hateful, ideology of radical Islam and promote American values and American culture and America's system of government.  Only by standing up for and supporting, we have to stand up for and support, our values can we become a united country once again [applause] A country of great jobs and wealth, a country of security and freedom, a country of strength and unity. The future is limitless. All we have to do is believe in America once again. We have to believe it can happen. It can happen. [applause] We will put back our faith in America's special destiny. We will lift the burdens on small business which is being driven into extinction by what's happening in our government. We'll create a level playing field for American workers. We'll never ever let what's happened to them happen to them again. We'll establish justice and opportunity and safety in every community in the land.  I am asking for the vote of every citizen in this country, African American, Hispanic, all Americans, all Americans who want a better, brighter and stronger future for yourselves and for our country. [applause] I am the change candidate. This is our moment to show the whole world that America is back, bigger and better and stronger than ever before. [applause] I am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House. I will be your champion and I will work hard to be your champion. And I won't be playing golf instead of going to see the people in Louisiana who have been devastated by floods. [applause] I'm going to be the champion to every parent who dreams for their children. And to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I am with you, I will fight for you, and we will win for you, we will win. [applause] Together we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, we will make America great again. Thank you and God bless you. Thank you, Mississippi. We love Mississippi. God bless you. Thank you. [applause]
t51.txt:Thank you everybody. This is a big, big crowd, you know? [applause] I'll tell you the same thing, however, the only people that will be shown on television won't be the 15,000 people, it'll be this group right over here. [applause] So, the good news is, you have better seats, or standing room only, but you have better, but they're going to be more famous, right? They're going to be more famous. [applause] Look, we want to have the cameras circle around and show this crowd, will you do that cameras? [applause] Go ahead cameras. [applause] They never do it. They never do it, so we won't waste our time, it's just the dishonest media. Look. [applause] We love being here, I love being with you. I love this state, as you know, I'm here all the time. [applause] In 27 days, we're going to win Florida [applause] and we're going to win back the White House. [applause] And that's what's happening folks, that's what's happening. [applause] We're going to bring back our jobs, we're going to end illegal immigration, we're going to renegotiate our totally disastrous I mean these deals, aye yai yai the trade deals the worst. We're going to renegotiate those trade deals, reduce surging crime. You saw what happened the other day, murders in the United States, the highest level in 45 years. You don't hear that from the press. [booing] We're going to cut taxes big league. Crooked Hillary is going to raise taxes. We're going to cut taxes and regulations. We're going to reduce the costs of education. By the way, we're going end the Common Core, and we're bringing our education local. [applause] We're going to lift the restrictions on American Energy and deliver real change for our great American people; it's time. [applause] And when it comes to international government, to massive trade deals, and to America's borders, we're going to defend the freedom and sovereignty of the United States of America like never before. [applause] And we are going to once again put America first. [applause] The deadline for voter register who is not registered? Is there anybody in here not registered? If you're not registered, get the hell out of here, OK? [applause] There's a nice looking young guy hey listen, leave right now and go and register. [applause] They just extended it for a little while, so right after you, raise your right hand. Do you promise you're going to register after this? If you like what I say, OK, if you like what I say. [applause] Seriously, I'm curious, who is not registered in this room? OK, all young people. Believe me, the young people like me better than Bernie, I'm telling you. [applause] Because with me, when you graduate from college, you're going to come out and you're going to have a vast array of jobs. OK, right? [applause] So go out and register, and we're going to have an awfully big I'll tell you what, honestly, we're going to have a big four years, eight years, we're going to have a big, great future for our country. [applause] Also, you can request an absentee ballot and you can vote by mail, if necessary. So, register, request a ballot. Thank you. I love you. I love you, too. The Hillary Clinton documents have you been seeing this, what's going on? Released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake in November and how unattractive and dishonest our country has become.  The election of Hillary Clinton would lead, in my opinion, to the almost total destruction of our country as we know it. She would be the most dishonest and the most corrupt person ever elected to high office. And I don't think it would be close.  The WikiLeaks e-mails show the Department of Justice fed information, did you see this? to the Clinton campaign. So think of this. The Department of Justice, you remember that whole deal with Wild Bill getting on the back of an airplane, just happened to be in Arizona.  He was gonna play golf. It was 110 degrees. But he gets on the back of the airplane to meet with the Attorney General to talk about his golf game and to talk about his grandkids. He was there for 39 minutes. [booing] I think most of us know what happened. [booing] So fed information, Department of Justice fed information think of this to the Clinton campaign about the e-mail investigation so that the campaign could be prepared to cover up her crimes. Now, did you ever hear [booing] Did you ever hear anything like this? [booing] And, and by the way, these dishonest people, mainstream media, they don't talk about this. They don't talk about this. Now, if I sneeze if Donald Trump sneezes today, it's a major story. [applause] Here you have Department of Justice coming to see them to brief them prior to their interview. Folks, this is out of control. And the FBI unbelievable people. You have incredible people in the FBI. I would be willing to be that they are so ashamed of what's happened at the upper level.  I would be willing to bet that they don't even sleep at night. These are great people. These are great Americans. And they can't believe what's going on. This corruption and collision is just one more reason why I will ask my Attorney General to appoint a special prosecutor. [applause] Our country has never been so low. In addition to a special prosecutor to look into what happened and all of the corruption, and all of the we'll say so called crime.  But look, when somebody deletes 33,000 e-mails after getting a subpoena. But we have to also remember this remember this. This is maybe in a sense even more important.  We have to investigate the investigation. [applause] We have to investigate the investigation. [applause] We've never had a case like this. And even Congress, you know, is sort of they've never had this before, because there's no event like this that ever took place.  Normally, Congress you know she lied to Congress. She lied to the FBI. And remember, he said she was negligent. She was all the things you needed to be, but she lied to Congress, she lied to the FBI, she lied to everybody she even lied in the debates about the gold standard, right.  Remember, she said, I never said gold standard. And remember when I said line in the sand? She said, I wasn't secretary of state. I said, I think you were, but let's see even the press said she was secretary of state, so she lied about that.  But think of this. Think of this. There's never been a time like this in our country. And Congress, in all fairness and I'm so disappointed in them. I am so disappointed in Congress. I am so disappointed. [applause] And I mean both sides. I'm not talking Republican Dem I'm talking everybody. To allow a thing like this to go this is crime at the highest level. She shouldn't be allowed to run for president. You know that. [applause] Other people's lives have been ruined, destroyed, for doing a tiny fraction of what she did. You saw the man with the book, he had to give back all the royalties and went through hell. You saw the man with the picture of the submarine, his mother goes around, she's devastated, devastated. Took pictures of a submarine. And you take a look at this.  So we have to investigate the investigation, and Congress but I speak to Congressmen. They don't know what to do. Because normally, they vote and they hand it over to the FBI and the Justice Department. But the FBI and the Justice Department won't do anything, so they don't know what to do. [booing] Now, they do make laws. Maybe they have to make up a law for a case like this. But they take these criminal acts, in my opinion, criminal acts, hand them over to the FBI, the FBI actually acknowledge that even, frankly, could have gone that speech could have been 10 times longer.  But all of these things yes, she did this, yes, she did this, yes, she did that, yes, she did that, but we're not going to do anything, right but what do you do when you hand them over to the FBI and the Justice Department and that's the end of it? We have never been in a position like this.  I'm so embarrassed by what's taken place, and I'm very, very disappointed in Congress because our people, our politicians I don't know, do they make a deal where everybody protects each other in Washington? Maybe that's it. I really believe it. I really believe it. I almost say, listen, we're going to leave you alone, but when it's our turn, you have to leave them alone. Do they make deals like this?  This is the most heinous, the most serious thing that I've ever seen involving justice in the United States in the history of the United States. We have a person that has committed crimes that is now running for the presidency, and she has the Justice Department, where she essentially told the AG in the speech or a talk that she'd appoint her AG again. And this is the person that's supposed to be ruling?  Folks, whether I win, lose, or draw, I'm ashamed of what's happened to our country and so are you. [applause] Hillary Clinton bleached and deleted 33,000 e-mails. And did you see, two days ago, boxes of e-mails and other things were missing? They were missing.  So she deleted 33,000 e-mails and bleached them. By the way, nobody bleaches; nobody I have people that are sophisticated in this world. They never even heard of it. They called it acid wash, meaning you can never retrieve them, although I have a feeling that the NSA has them. They don't want them. They don't want to get them. I have a feeling. [applause] So then she did this after, not before. Before would be bad. She did this after getting a congressional subpoena. Now, if your friend is suing you in a regular lawsuit, and you do that, you go to jail. Here's the United States Congress subpoenas her e-mails and other things, and she deletes the e-mails, saying there are 33,000 e-mails remember? for the wedding and for yoga classes 33,000 e-mails. [applause] And then and then after all of that, now they're missing two boxes of perhaps the most important of the group. And what about her law firm? You know what? She's using a phenomenal law firm. I know the firm. Phenomenal law firm. They're the ones that did all this stuff. Remember, they said we made a ruling they were work-related. You can't do that. If they're work- related, what you do is you show them you show them and you get them. It's a law firm nobody ever mentions. The law firm is unbelievable. It's very powerful. OK?  Obviously, they've done a great job. But that law firm should be implicated in this crime. OK? [applause] They're the ones they got rid of all this stuff. The law firm got rid of all this stuff. And they should be implicated because they have committed a crime. They are not supposed to say, "Oh, we got rid of most of it." That law firm that I know very well, as I said total professionals, total insiders they got rid of 33,000 and much more than that. It is one of the great miscarriages of justice.  So then she destroyed her phones, some with a hammer, to cover up her crimes. Now, how many of you people have gotten rid of cell phones and you start whacking them with a hammer? Has any please raise your hand? Please. One. What business are you in?  I see two hands. We have 15,000. Two hands. Anybody else? It is so disgraceful. It's so embarrassing. And by the way, we're going to go over some of the WikiLeaks stuff. The press hardly reports it. They hardly report it. She did a big number of Catholics, horrible number on Catholics. She did a horrible number on evangelicals through her people.  And they hardly report it. While she was secretary of state, she lost or disappeared almost $6 billion. Does anyone know that? No. How do you lose $6 billion? Even Chelsea Clinton in the WikiLeaks emails expressed, quote, "serious concerns about conflicts of interest at the Clinton Foundation and the State Department."  Americans have had it with the years and decades of Clinton corruption. It's corruption Whitewater, cattle. [applause] Never is with these people. Remember years ago most of you are too young to remember. Remember the cattle? She bought some cattle and she had the greatest return, like almost in the history of cattle deals? And some of these professional cattlemen and cattle women they say, boy, she's really good at this stuff. They'd been doing it all their lives, they had never had a return like that. It's corruption, folks. It's corruption.  They understood that, by the way. They're smart, they got it very quickly. This will finally be the year the American people say, enough is enough. During a recent trip to Florida, I had a chance to spend some time with the incredible residents of Little Haiti, and you see what's going on in Haiti, it's a horrible thing. And you see what's going on with Clinton, it's a horrible thing. These are not fans of Clinton. That, I can tell you.  They despise the Clintons for what they did to the Haitian people. New e-mails revealed by ABC News just yesterday show that during the deadly earthquake in Haiti, which killed over 150,000 people, the Clintons couldn't stop cashing in. They kept cashing in.  As people were dying in Haiti, Clinton insiders were separating out requests from friends of Bill or William Jefferson Clinton VIPs so that their business interests or contracts would receive very special treatment, while those who were not special friends would be put permanently on the sidelines.  And remember this. Hillary's brother, running a gold mine, put on the gold Tony, you saw Tony. Tony. Anybody want to hire Tony? He's put on the board of a big gold mine company, having to do with Haiti. It's so bad.  Look, we're in a rigged system, folks. This is a rigged, rigged system. You saw so many of the things. I'll tell you, this WikiLeaks stuff is unbelievable. It tells you the inner heart you got to read it. And you got to maybe get it, because they're not putting it out. They want to put it out, but they can't do that, because without the media and without the press, Hillary Clinton would be nothing. She'd be nothing. Zero. [applause] And by the way, did everybody see the debate the other day, yes? [applause] So they had nine online polls. Some of them had us 90 to 10, 80 to 20. "Time Magazine" had like a massive look, "Time Magazine" is no friend of mine except they put me on the cover so much. Not because they like me, because they like selling magazines.  But "Time Magazine" it was total destruction. And then the next morning, she walks in and says, did everybody see the debate? People go, yes, yes. Did we beat her or what? I look so forward[applause] I do. I look so forward to the next one in Las Vegas. As Haiti's death toll from Hurricane Matthew is on the rise, we should never forget how Bill and Hillary Clinton handled Haiti the last time. To all our friends in Little Haiti they're great people. I mean, I spent a long time these are people that are incredible. They have the warmest feeling, the warmest heart. But to all of our friends in Little Haiti, your day of justice is coming, believe me. [applause] And it arrives on November 8. November 8, get out and vote. The new e-mails also show members of the Clinton team viciously attacking Catholics and Evangelicals. They attacked Catholics and evangelicals. [booing] Viciously. [booing] And that won't be tolerated but it won't be tolerated by the voters. Tell you what anybody of religion I really think you have to vote for Donald Trump to be honest with you. I really do believe it. [applause] And in all of the primaries you saw that. I wasn't expected to win with evangelicals but once we got started and once they heard my message as opposed to other people's messages we really we won big with evangelicals. They're incredible people. [applause] Remember the Johnson Amendment. We're gonna get rid of that Johnson Amendment. Just remember that. [applause] These emails are just the latest evidence of the hatred that the Clinton campaign has for everyday faithful Americans. True. The Wikileaks email show that Hillary Clinton's staff, even has to give her secret notes on when she needs to smile. Smile Hillary. Smile. [applause] Hey folks, we have to get back to work. Our country's in trouble. We can't play games anymore. Smile. You believe it? Smile. [applause] And how about where it said to the public you say this, but to the others that give you the money you say that. I'll tell you. It's so revealing somebody's going to do a great book on that, because the press just did not little tiny stories, big, big things. Getting answers for debates and questions for debates, before the debate takes place. How about that?  I'll tell you what. Can you imagine me, if any of this stuff pertained to me? Front page headlines all over the world, Donald Trump oh well, we've been there and we seem to be doing really well.  Hillary Clinton, commonly referred to as Crooked Hillary, thinks that you all of you are deplorable and totally irredeemable. [applause] I actually think irredeemable is worse, I don't know. I'm the only one. Deplorable and irredeemable. Irredeemable meaning, meaning you can never, ever come back. I call you hard-working American patriots, and together we are going to save this country and we are going to make America great again. [applause] And it's hot as hell in here but I don't care. [applause] Call it Florida, right? Florida. [applause] Emails also show that the DNC vice-chair was feeding information so much information to the candidate. Oh man, I want that why can't the Republicans do that? Why can't Reince feed me information prior to a debate. I'm so angry at the Republicans I want to be fed information like Hillary gets. [applause] And we still beat her badly, right? So I mean what's the big deal? But I want information. The Republicans are not doing their job. They should be able to get me all of the questions prior to the debate.  This all comes after a secret tape that shows Hillary Clinton calling Bernie voters now look Bernie I feel sorry for Bernie. He made a deal with the devil and he blew his reputation. But she called Bernie voters basement dwellers. So all of the Bernie votes out there, join our movement, like all of these young people. We're going to fix our trade deals and get special interests out of government.  And by the way, by the time this ends, I'll have over a hundred million dollars of my money in this thing, right, which means that's $100 million of people that don't have to give me money and say, Donald, will you do this, will you do that, will you do that? [applause] That's a lot of money. [applause] And I asked her the other night, I said, you know, I will have over a hundred million and that's a lot of money. If I lose, I'm going to be so angry at Florida. [laughter] I'll still love you, I think. Maybe not. [applause] You know, one of the pundits said, and you've heard me say this maybe, but they said, Mr. Trump, it doesn't matter whether you win or lose. You have done the single greatest job. nobody's ever done a thing like this before. No matter where we go it's like this. But... [applause] They said it's the single Bill O'Reilly said it, but many peoples said, it's the single greatest political phenomena they've ever seen. I said, wait a minute, you're wrong.  If I don't win on November 8th, I will consider this the single greatest waste of time, energy and money of anything I've ever done, because we're not going to be able to reduce your taxes, we're not going to be able to save your Second Amendment, appoint Supreme Court judges, take care of you vets, fix up your depleted, very depleted the greatest people on earth but our military is so depleted.  We're going to take care of a lot of things, including getting the drugs out. A vote for Hillary is a vote for more reckless foreign invasions. What a mess did she do does she go down as the all-time worst?  More Wall Street cheating, more terrible trade deals. And as WikiLeaks showed, she wants to cut your Medicare and Social Security benefits. You didn't see that. [booing] See? And I'm not going to. The press doesn't report that she wants to cut your Social Security. And she wants to cut Medicare and one of the big advantages of me having a rather large microphone, meaning a lot of people are listening, is that I can talk about WikiLeaks and look it's on al the television networks live. We're live. [applause] Amazing. [applause] I think they are just turning them all off now. Watch. You go home, they'll say, why did it end so abruptly? A vote for Trump is a vote for America first and it's a vote to protect Medicare and Social Security and lower your taxes. [applause] Big, big tax decrease. We're going to lower your taxes. WikiLeaks also shows something I've been warning about for a very, very long time. The media is simply an extension of the Clinton Campaign. [booing]  It's one of the biggest ways that our system is rigged. And I was the first one to use that term when I was running in the primaries when I won Louisiana and I got fewer delegates than people that I beat easily.  And my people said, oh no, that's the way the system I say, well then the system's wrong! How do you win a state and you get less delegates? And I said, this system is rigged! And it was, but we figured out how to win, right? That's what you need. [applause] Won in a landslide. I got more votes than anybody in the history of the Republican Party in the primaries system [applause] By far. Wasn't even close. [applause] Reporters who work for these outlets like the Washington Post or the New York Times may think of themselves as journalists, but they're actually cogs for a corrupt political machine. That's the Clinton machine. The e-mail show the New York Times, the Boston Globe, Univision who I sued I sued Univision, and I was very happy with what they did. [booing] And this lightweight, you know John Hardwood, this lightweight. This guy who came out, he was shaking. He was so nervous. He asked me the first question, "Mr. Trump, could you answer this question?" What a lightweight. They shoulda fired him for what he did. John Harwood. I hate to make him famous but 'cause nobody ever heard of him before, but a total lightweight of CNBC all doing favors for the Clintons. And reporters smothering the Clintons with praise. The New York Times even gave Clinton a call to give her a veto power over her quotes in a story that was already written. Nobody ever called me and said, "Hi, Mr. Trump. We wrote a story. Would you read the story and please give us a little feedback. Would you like us to take anything out?"  This system is so rigged. Now, this is all down in the e-mails. She had veto power over what she said. I'll tell you what. I want to have that, too. I want to have veto power. I used to get such good publicity, folks. Now, I mean it's like it's incredible. I used to get my life was so simple. My life was so simple. I had a beautiful, simple life. It was going. I built an unbelievable company. And then I decide to do this, and my life became slightly more complex. You know, we have people in this audience right now that 18 years ago had one great job, they were making more money 18 years ago than they're making now. And now they have two and sometimes three jobs. In other words, they're older and they're working harder, and they're making less.  Not a good not a good assemblage of facts. Here's the only good news. I'm also older and working harder than I've ever worked before. OK? That I can tell you. [applause] Including being in this wonderful area at 114 degrees temperature. [applause] Which is great 'cause you go home and you lose weight. I mean why you can't be. You go home, you say, "I feel great. I lost a lot of weight."  By the way, let Hillary Clinton stand up here for an hour and talk the way I talk, and let's see how long she lasts folks. [applause] Oh, what a joke what a total joke. Our country's in such trouble. That's why I'm I it's just so ridiculous. The corporate media can't report on the establishment because the corporate media is the establishment, such a big part of it. We're going to break up the special interest monopoly, and we're going to win this country back for the American people. We're gonna do it, too. [applause] The e-mails also reveal that Hillary Clinton believes in global governments, unlimited immigration unlimited, much more than Obama. From the Middle East, come right in. Come right in.  550 percent more than President Obama, who is grossly incompetent. He doesn't know what the hell he's doing. [applause] And why is he campaigning? We just had a horrible jobs report. We have no growth. You saw GDP at one percent we have no growth. We have a horrible jobs report. China is ripping us off. Japan is ripping us off with the cars. Mexico has a unbelievable deal with us, both on the border I mean, look at our trade deficit with Mexico. And China, and Vietnam, and everybody.  Last year, our country had a trade deficit of almost $800 billion. $800 billion. [booing] Who the hell negotiates these deals? I mean, can you believe it? So I say, why the hell is Obama allowed to campaign for Hillary Clinton? He's always campaigning, and he's doing his little thing, you know, having a good time. He ought to be out in the White House. He's not there long. He ought to be there working and fixing some of these horrible trade deals and bringing jobs back to our country, not campaigning for a crooked person, for a totally dishonest and crooked person. [applause] Speaking in secret to a foreign bank, Hillary Clinton said, my dream is a hemispheric common market that's not good for your jobs with totally open trade and open borders. 600 million people could pour into the United States. You'll have nothing left.  Tell you, if that happens, I know the real estate here, I love the real estate here sell fast. Behind closed doors, when she thought no one was listening, she pledged to dissolve the borders of the United States of America. This all came out. She said she wants to dissolve the borders. And here I am saying, we want strong borders. We don't want drugs coming in. We don't want crime coming in. I don't know, maybe I'm wasting my time. Am I wasting my time? I don't think so. [applause] She doesn't want to have any borders. Total amnesty tell you what, folks. This is the last time you'll ever have a chance to save our country. It's not going to happen. You won't be able to. The numbers will be too great. Already, the Republican nominee has a massive disadvantage, and especially when you have the leaders not putting their weight behind the people. They're not putting their weight behind the people[booing] Instead of calling me and saying, congratulations, you did a great job. You absolutely destroyed her in the debate, like everybody said you know, Pat Buchanan wrote the big article today, you saw it—I'm not bragging, I'm just saying—maybe a little bit, but here—he said it was the single greatest debate performance in the history of presidential politics. [applause] So wouldn't you think that Paul Ryan would call and say, good going? In front of just about the largest audience for a second night debate in the history of the country. So you know, you'd think that they'd say, great going, Don. Let's go, let's beat this crook. She's a crook. Let's beat her. We got to stop it. No, he doesn't do that.  There's a whole deal going on there. I mean, you know, there's a whole deal going on and we're going to figure it out. I always figure things out. But there's a whole sinister deal going on.  Crooked Hillary wants to end forever the American independence that our founders gave us. Our great founders are spinning in their graves. Our founders are spinning in their graves like Douglas MacArthur, like George Patton, like our generals. They're spinning in their grave and by the way, General Flynn and all the generals - over 200 admirals and generals have endorsed Donald Trump.  Two hundred. Over 200. [applause] Twenty-one congressional Medal of Honor recipients have endorsed Donald Trump. I'll tell you, you know what I like? Very smart, tough people like me. I like that. The smart, tough people, they like Trump.  American soldiers have fought and died to win and keep America's freedom and now Hillary Clinton wants to surrender that freedom to open borders, open trade, and world government. And I do believe in free trade but I believe more in smart trade.  We're going to make great deals with other countries. We're going to bring jobs back. We're going to bring jobs back. [applause] I'm not running to be president of the world. I'm running to be president of the United States of America. [applause] Oh, I wish those cameras would turn so some time our friends back in New York and back in Pennsylvania and back in Ohio and all these different states, they could see the crowds but they do hear it. You know, when you hear the noise, they say they never show the crowd but you hear the crowd. You can't imitate that noise. [applause] We will never surrender the freedom and sovereignty of the United States. It's going to be America first, America first, America first. [applause] And yesterday, Hillary had Al Gore - climate change. Now, I want - just so you know - do you know that I've won numerous environmental awards? I'm a believer in the environment. It's got to be within reason. I'm a believer. Here's what I want, though. I want immaculately clean water and I want immaculately clean air. That's what I want. That's called climate change. That's called environmental protection [applause] But Hillary had this deal. Very, very lightly attended and I watched on television as they said this is the largest crowd that she's had. You know what she's got? Like a tiny little fraction. Now, they're not going to say look at the crowd with crooked Hillary yesterday. She had Al Gore get up, this poor guy. [booing] I don't know what the hell happened to him. What happened to him? She had Al Gore get up, because don't forget, Obama thinks that climate change is the single biggest and most dangerous problem for the world today. [booing] Not nuclear weapons in the hands of maniacs or in the hands of countries that hate us. No, no that's no problem. Climate change is our problem. I'll tell you how this going, how we're doing folks. If we don't win this election, I don't know what I'm going to do. [applause] I don't know. No, no can you imagine? Here's a guy where we have ISIS that he essentially founded, if you look. Remember I said, founded and he's going to get the medal for having—and I kiddingly. But it's really not that kiddingly but then they put it on Mo Bisely, he found and I says, let me tell you something. When they pulled out of Iraq the way they—we should have never been in Iraq and I was against it and they know it.  But we should have never been in Iraq. But when we were, the way he pulled out, he announced when he's leaving, he pulled out everybody instead of leaving, groups behind. And they created a vacuum and ISIS was formed. Now think of this because the biggest thing that came out of the debate in my opinion, and it really came out of the first debate, which if I didn't have fixed microphone or a broken microphone, nobody's been able to tell me, but I watched.  Couldn't talk very good because my mike didn't work. But I watched and I said you know, it's interesting. Hillary said she's going to do this and this and this but she's been there for 30 years, she never did it. [applause] And I said to her in the second debate, I said let me ask you a question. Let me—and by the way, you know that so-called Commission on Presidential Debates, the head guy used to work for Bill Clinton. Did you know that? I just found that out. The head guy worked for Bill Clinton. What a rigged deal this is. But here's the story. I have no respect for that group by the way, I have none. It sounds good. Presidential commission, give me a break. [applause] That's why I was so happy what we did to annihilate the enemy the other day. So happy. [applause] Because we're dealing against a very dishonest system. But Hillary, so important, wants to have a radical, and this is very radical, immigration. She wants to radicalize immigration where you have people pouring in. Remember this, the border patrol agents, 16,500 gave me their endorsement. Last week, ICE, ICE, these are great people, you don't hear great things because they're not allowed to do their job.  These are people that frankly, would work a lot less. I mean their job's easier if Hillary wins because basically all they have to do is stand there and watch people walk in front of them. ICE, these are great people. Tough people, smart people. First time in their history they endorse me, they've got to work harder, and they endorse me. [applause] And one of the things they told me that I thought was terrible is that she refused when she was secretary of state to make foreign countries take back their criminal aliens. In other words, we have somebody in from a foreign country illegally. The person kills somebody, hurts somebody, robs a store, robs a bank, does all sorts—sells drugs all over the place, poisons our youth. And we want to send them back to the country from which they came and they bring them back and the country says, we're not taking them.  Because they're smart. They don't want them. So they bring them back into the United States and put him into our society. I guarantee you, and you can mark my words, and there's a lot of tape running, that won't happen once when Donald Trump is president; not once, guarantee you that. [applause] One convicted criminal alien, she allowed to go free—totally free; killed a young girl named Casey Chadwick; beautiful young girl. The corrupt establishment in Washington wants to surrender America's borders, even as they send our troops overseas to protect the borders of other countries. She'll protect those borders, but not our borders.  Casey Chadwick was a great example, and he was let free, and she should be alive today. Jamiel Shaw has a son—had a son, a great young man, killed violently. And I don't know if you know, but killed violently by an illegal immigrant, shot three times in the face for no reason; somebody that wasn't supposed to be here.  And you have—you have case after case after case. We're not going to have it anymore. We're not going to be the stupid people anymore. We're not going to be the stupid, weak people anymore. [applause] A Trump administration will secure, control, defend and protect the borders of the United States, as sure as you are standing here today. [applause] We will 100 percent build the wall, 100 percent. [applause] Are you ready? Are you ready? [applause] And who is going to pay for the wall? Audience: "Mexico" 100 percent. They just don't know it yet. They don't know it yet, but 100 percent. They'll pay for the wall. Hey, look, we're going to have a great relationship with Mexico and China and all of these countries that are ripping us off and now have no respect. They're going to make less and they're going to like us more. Funny how that works, but it's true. Mexico is making a fortune with trade. They're taking our jobs. So many things. They are going to respect us finally.  We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country. Florida has seen a 470 percent increase in heroin deaths. Think of that—think if you have a child—470 percent increase in heroin deaths since 2007. Think of that. Think of your kids and your grandkids.  We're going to stop it. And most of it's coming across the southern border. And let me tell you, when we allow ICE and when we allow the Border Patrol agents and when we give them that big beautiful wall with a door in it so people can come in, but they have to come in legally; we want them to come in, but they have to come in legally. [applause] We will stop the drugs from poisoning our youth and others. [applause] But I have a message for the drug dealers, for the gang members and the criminal cartels: Your days are numbered, believe me; your days are numbered. [applause] Hillary also wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees. We don't know anything about them. [booing] This, even though she admitted in private according to WikiLeaks, just out, that she knows terrorists are trying to infiltrate—she knows it—they're trying to infiltrate our refugee program. So she said it just yesterday that she knows they're trying to come in through that method, and yet she wants 550 percent more than even Obama's staggeringly high numbers, thousands and thousands.  We can't let it happen. And we all have a heart, and we'll build safe havens and we'll have the Gulf States pay because they're not doing their share. Believe me, they're not. They have plenty of money, they'll pay. We can't pay. We owe $20 trillion. 20 trillion, doubled during Obama years. Doubled. He doubled the debt during his years.  In fact, the terrorists have already infiltrated our country. There are now 1,000 open ISIS investigations in our 50 states. A record. Attack after attack, including the recent terror strikes in New Jersey, New York, Minnesota, as well as the mall shooting in Washington, were made possible by our extremely open immigration system that's meant only to protect fools, and we're not fools. [booing] So let me state this clearly as I can. I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. [applause] She won't even use the word. She won't even use the term. Our incompetent president—I call him our campaign president—our incompetent president won't use the term radical Islamic terrorism. He won't use it. He tries to explain it. He spends hours trying to explain why. If you don't identify your problem, folks, you're never going to get rid of it. It's only getting worse.  And remember, I said it before, we've started off when he became president with no ISIS. Nobody head the term ISIS, which he calls ISIL, right. You know why he does that? Because he likes disturbing all of you. He calls ISIL. But we started off, we had no ISIS. And now, 7 1/2 years later, they're in, they think, 32 countries.  And she's going to get rid of them? I can tell you this. They are hoping and they are praying—they are hoping and praying that Hillary Clinton becomes president of the United States, because they'll take over not only that part of the world. They'll take over this country, they'll take over this part of the world, believe me. They are hoping.  And by the way, she likes to say, they want me—I will be their worst nightmare. I'm going to be their worst nightmare. [applause] And she lied during the debate. Remember when I said the red line in the sand, right? She said, I wasn't secretary of state then, all flustered, all crazy. She was there when they drew the line. I walked out, they said, you know, she was there. Oh, well, she sort of said she wasn't. She was there.  It turned out to be a lie. And even the media said that they hated - she lied about that. She lied about many things. She put Iran on the path to nuclear weapons. You know, this horrible Iran deal where they gave $400 million in cash, but it turned out to be $1.7 billion in cash. You couldn't fit that in the back of this arena, that's how much money it is.  She gave - they gave that much money to the terrorists, to our enemies. And by the way, our enemies aren't even nice to us. Now they're emboldened. You see the little boats going around our beautiful ships doing all sorts of little things to drive our people crazy. Folks, they're not gonna do that stuff when I'm president, I guarantee ya. [applause] You see the way they captured our ten sailors 'cause they were a little bit in the wrong waters. And instead of saying nicely, "Hey, listen. You gotta be over there a little bit", they humiliated the sailors, humiliated their families, and humiliated our country, right.  And the only reason they let 'em go is that our payments of $150 billion started the next day. So stupid they're not. And when they fly - they - they flew right alongside of our - our planes the other. You saw that? Their jet fighters. Right, you saw that? And when Putin is buzzing - you know Hillary's tough with Russia. You ever notice anything that goes wrong, they blame Russia. Russia did it. They have no idea. We're being hacked because we have people that don't know what they're doing.  They have people. But they always blame Russia and then they say, "Donald Trump is friends with Putin." I don't know Putin, folks. I promise. I don't know Putin. What the hell do I have to do with Putin? These people are professional con people. They're con. And this country can't have it. This country can't have it. And - and by the way, Russia, which is buzzing our ships, right. You know, tough Hillary, tough Obama, they're buzzing. You saw that two weeks ago, buzzing, planes going by. They took over - yeah, they took over. You look at Ukraine. They took over during - that was Crimea. They took that over during Obama's reign. You know, tough Obama. He's so tough. He's so tough. So, look, we need competence and we need it fast. Hillary Clinton who turned Libya into a nightmare. How about Libya? How about Benghazi? How about - how about Benghazi where Ambassador Stevens sent 600 different messages to Hillary Clinton, and she didn't even respond.  The only one she spoke to was that sleaze Sidney Blumenthal, her friend who Obama told her you cannot deal with, and she did behind Obama's back. [booing] A Trump Administration will stop the reckless interventions, and instead focus on defeating and totally destroying ISIS. We're also going to build up our cyber defenses. Cyber's a big thing.  And keep our power grid and our vital infrastructure modern and safe. And the word "keep" is an incorrect word because we have to rebuild it. It's a mess. Show Less Text It's so old, it's falling apart. And we're going to use cyber offense to disrupt the enemy where we need to and keep them from recruiting online. ISIS is taking our children, and taking our kids out of our country because they're using the internet better than we know how to use it. And we're the ones that came up with it.  At the same time, we're going to completely rebuild our very depleted military. We're going to take care of our people. [applause] And that includes building state-of-the-art systems of all kind. When it comes to keeping America safe, I believe in three very important words: peace through strength. We don't want to use the military. [applause] But it's got to be there. [applause] And just in closing, to be strong, our country has to be rich again. We're a debtor nation. We're poor. I'm going to make America rich again. [applause] My enemy—our enemies are unbelievable. They love what's happening to our country. They love it. Our energy proposals won't lock the $50 trillion in energy reserves right here in America under our feet. This means new jobs in Florida and many, many other communities. Pennsylvania, Ohio, we're going to take care of our miners, we're going to take care of our steelworkers, we're going to take care of natural gas. We're going to have clean coal. We're going to also have all forms of advanced energy.  We also have to repeal and replace it. We will do this and it's so important because it's driving everybody and small businesses and big businesses and our country out of business. Repeal and replace Obamacare. [applause] Bill Clinton, in a rare moment of truth-telling, said last week Obamacare was a crazy system where people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. What kind of a system is this?  Oh, did he suffer that evening. He went home aye yai yai, poor Bill. He suffered. You see, the next he came back and he said he was only kidding. He was only kidding. It's a disaster.  Obamacare - you know, your rates are going up 68 percent. In Texas they had 71 percent. In other communities they're going to go 95 percent and 100 percent, and next year is going to be worse. We have no choice but to absolutely repeal, replace Obamacare we're going to come up with a much better plan for much less money. [applause] As you know also, most counties in the state will only have one insurer to choose from. Obama does that because that way they have a monopoly so they can charge you whatever the hell they want.  This is our chance to stop the abusive and horrible and—and something that doesn't work, Obamacare, and save American healthcare, but you have to get out and vote.  At the center of our economic revival, we'll be fixing our terrible trade deals. When I announced, seems like a long time now, June 16th coming down with Melania at the escalator, remember, in Trump Tower, was an amazing - that was an amazing thing and we announced that it was a big part.  And then I came out and I said Florida and our countries, we have all of these lost jobs. All of our lost manufacturing. We're going to get it back. We're bringing our jobs back.  When countries come in and think they're going to steal our companies and our companies are going to go out and fire all of their employees in Florida, in Ohio, in Pennsylvania, in all of these countries. All of these—everyone. We are not going to allow it to happen. We are not going to allow it.  We are going to tell it, you are going to have consequences. The states are not going to put up with it anymore. Our federal government is going to help.  We've built other countries at our expense. We have. So, if they come in like they did in Indiana - where Mike Pence, by the way, is doing a great job. [applause] And they take - in the case, they take - Mexico takes care of your air conditioner, and they fire their 1,400 people who were so great to me. And they think they're going to make air conditioners in their beautiful new plant in Mexico, and sell them across the border and make lots of money, and we have all the employment. Not going to happen. We're going to put a 35 percent tax on and they're staying in the United States [applause] And if they don't, we're going to make plenty of money. [applause] We are going to rebuild our country. Our country is going to be a country where you can be proud of again. We're going to use American steel, we're going to use American labor, we are going to come first in all deals.  We're not going to make the trade deal where we come in fifth and sixth and seventh and other countries laugh at our stupidity. We are going to build great companies. We are going to expand companies that are now doing poorly. We are going to make our country very rich again.  We are going to make our country very safe again. [applause] We are going to make America strong again. And we are going to make America great again. God bless you, everybody. God bless you. Thank you.
t57.txt:In 21 days, we are going to win the state of Colorado and we're going to win the White House. We're going to take it back. [applause] And while I'm at it, make sure you mail in those ballots before election day. Early voting starts on the 24th, you've got to mail them in. But get there, November 8th.  I'd like to also start today by recognizing the incredible military contributions of Colorado Springs, a place I actually know very well. One of the most beautiful places, by the way. We have such amazing people working at Fort Carson, Peterson Air Force Base, the United States Space Command, NORAD, Schriever Air Force Base and the United States Air Force Academy. Good place. [applause] I've got many friends that went to the Air Force Academy, all very smart. They love their airplanes, that I can tell you. The courage and selflessness of our service members and their devotion to each other and to their country are the traits that we need to make America great again. [applause] Great people. Together, we're going to deliver real change that puts America first. You don't hear that term very much. We don't hear that term very much anymore, do we? America first, right? If I win, it's going to be America first every single time, that I can tell you. Believe me. [applause] We're going to end the government corruption and we're going to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. [applause] We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees from other countries, reduce surging crime, cut taxes big league and end regulations. [applause] Unleash job-producing American energy, rebuild our great military, which sadly has become very depleted, but the greatest people on Earth. We're going to take care of our veterans like they have never been taken care of before. And repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. [applause] Your jobs will come back under a Trump administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump administration. Your taxes will go down under a Trump administration. [applause] Your country and I tell you, your country is so proud of you, but right now we have to help our country. We have to help our country. It is under siege in so many ways. By the way, you could almost stay, especially from the dishonest media, that's for sure. [applause] Very dishonest. Your companies won't be leaving Colorado under a Trump administration. They'll be expanding and there will be new companies coming in. Right now, we're not growing at all as a nation. You look at our jobs report, a disaster. Last week a jobs report, total disaster. Look at our GNP, total disaster.  Under my plan, we're going to grow at 4 percent. Right now, we're at about 1 percent. [applause] China's at 7 percent. India's at 8 percent. We're at 1 percent and it's going to be going down if we keep if Hillary Clinton gets in, you will set record lows, believe me. That I can tell you. [applause] We're going to create at least 25 million new jobs in 10 years. And by the way, did you see the protesters yesterday, where they call them. The protesters are paid a lot of money by the DNC. And I kept saying, I wonder why those people are here? Because they never seem to have much on their mind, other than stand up and protest.  And yesterday it came out, but it was barely covered by the media. But it's all over the media. They were busted. They were paid $1,500 each and were given cell phones go up and disturb Trump rallies. And I sort of always knew it, in Chicago, even last night. We had people stand up for no reason. It's like, what are they doing here? And can you imagine, that's a big story, hardly covered by the media. [applause] So bad. We're also going to create a new government that answers to the people. Hillary Clinton—Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to run for the presidency. [applause] She shouldn't be allowed to run for the presidency after what she's done. I'll tell you. It's true. Newly released, two days ago, FBI documents reveal just how deep the corruption goes. The undersecretary of state, Patrick Kennedy, illegally pressured the FBI to unclassify e-mails from Hillary Clinton's illegal server. [applause] It's hard to believe. And nothing happens to her, folks, and nothing ever happens. In other words, the State Department was trying to cover up Hillary's crime of sending classified information on a server our enemies could easily access. [applause] The FBI document show that Patrick Kennedy made the request for altering classification as part of a very, very serious quid pro quo. Not allowed to do it. This is a felony corruption. Yesterday, I said Undersecretary Kennedy must immediately resign. [applause] The media barely covers this event, by the way. [applause] This is a bigger event than Watergate and they practically refuse to cover it. Today, I'm calling for him to be fired. [applause] Clinton and her cronies have sacrificed your security, your family's safety and your country's safety as though it meant nothing at all to her. [applause] Remember also that Hillary lied under oath to Congress, saying that she never sent or received classified information on her secret server. Right? She never received it on that insecure server, that she should have never been allowed to have. That you're not allowed to have. And pretended not to know. Remember this one: that the letter "C" meant confidential information was classified. [applause] She thought it was the lettering of a paragraph. [applause] There's never been a time in our country's history where anything like this has gone on. And the FBI, there must be people in there, based on what you read, that are ashamed of what's happened. And the Department of Justice, there must be people in there that are ashamed, absolutely ashamed of what's been going on.  Hillary then told the FBI she couldn't remember 39 times. And then in written testimony last week, under oath, she said that she couldn't remember another 21 times. Bad memory. She's got a terrible memory. [applause] This elaborate, criminal cover up included Hillary's deleting and bleaching of 33,000 e-mails. The disappearance of 13 iPhones, some by hammers, two boxes of e-mail evidence gone missing, that was as of last week. Can you imagine they're now missing on top of everything else, two boxes of e-mails? And the destruction of laptops, in a secret deal with the FBI. [applause] This truly is, and I said it, this truly is many times worse than Watergate. And we're going to put an end to it on November 8th. [applause] Going to do it. [applause] Another series of leaked e-mails show top officials in the Clinton campaign scheming to take massive sums of money from registered foreign lobbyists. And then you wonder why we do so badly. But you don't hear the media talking about that at all, do you? You don't see it at all. As WikiLeaks proved, the media, is merely, and it truly is, it's just an extension of the Clinton campaign. [applause] The press has created a rigged system and poisoned the mind of so many of our voters. They have rigged it from the beginning by telling totally false stories. Most recently about phony allegations where I have been under constant attack. They attack my business. I built a great business but, although most people do admit that. They attacked my wonderful family. They attacked my temperament.  But I built an incredible company, those papers are filed. And I'm fortunate to have a beautiful and loving family. You all saw Melania last night on television. Did a great job. [applause] That she even has to do that is a shame. And my temperament has always been just about my greatest strength. We have a winning temperament. Our country doesn't win anymore. We don't win anymore. This is an election about truth. And you're not going to get it from the dishonest media.  Some people can't handle the truth. No matter what people may think of me, the one thing they know is that we're going to tell the American people where we stand, where we are. We're going to tell them the truth. [applause] Now even though we're doing pretty good in the polls, I don't believe the polls anymore. I don't believe them. I don't believe them. And if there's 10, and if there's one or two bad ones, that's the only one they show.  Believe me, folks, we're doing great. If we keep our spirit, and if we go out and win, this is another Brexit, believe me. They are so worried. That's why they've become vicious and hostile and dirty because they see what's going on. This rally set up just a short while ago; look at the number of people, packed. But every rally is the same way. [applause] At her rallies, very few people show up, when she has the energy to go to the event. Which isn't often. She's doing debate prep. She did so much debate prep. Did we beat her badly in that second debate? [applause] Sort of funny. She's been doing this for 30 years. Now she has to do debate prep for five days. You know what the debate prep is? It's resting. It's lying down, going to sleep. I think the media's trying to discourage our people from going out to vote. And it was just brought up to me by a reporter in the back.  They said, you know, it's very interesting, when you were fighting 17 people, the media was nasty, but they really got nasty when we started to take the lead in the polls. They said, "Wait a minute, this thing's going to happen. It's going to happen."  Change stop our jobs from leaving, our companies from leaving, strengthen our military, preserve our Second Amendment. They're saying, this is going to happen. And it is true. Made up stories. They're liars and made up stories.  Without the media and all of the other corrupt entities that have helped her along the way, she would be nothing. She would be nothing. She really—she would be doing so badly. Even my worst critics agree that the media has come after us like they have never come after anyone before. It's my badge of honor.  I mean, you know, what am I going to do? Even the New York Times, which is totally dishonest, by the way—here's the good news about the New York Times. They won't be in business much longer. Do you see what they're losing? [applause] They are dying. They are dying. And they're dying also because they're very dishonest. But one of their biggest columnist-reporters wrote a story about how bad it is. He said, let's face it—this is in the New York Times "balance has been on vacation since Mr. Trump stepped onto this golden Trump Tower escalator to announce his candidacy."  Can you believe that? They're admitting it. They don't even care. It actually said that we don't care. They will do anything to stop what we're doing. Not me, it's what we're doing. It's an agenda. It's going to agenda of change. But we won't let them stop maybe the greatest movement in the history of our country.  History is watching us now, waiting to see if we will rise to the moment. We have to rise. We have to do it. We're under tremendous opposition. We have the greatest people in the world. That's what I've learned. Somebody said, what's the most important thing you learned? How great the American people are. I've gone all over the country.  I have two things I've learned that, and I've learned how totally dishonest the media is. It's so dishonest. I've learned that, too. They are the most dishonest people I've ever dealt with. Not all of them, but, honestly, like 75 percent. Some are very good, but for the most part, yes.  We have stories that we think are going to unbelievable stories. They turn out—they make them as bad as possible. We have stories on the other side that would normally dismantle a campaign, and they don't even report them. It's a disgrace. What's going on is a disgrace.  But we've only just begun to fight, believe me. We have three weeks. You know what, we have three weeks. And I hear we're going great in Colorado. My people in back said, "You're going to win Colorado, doesn't matter what they say." [applause] Get out and vote. But they even want to try and rig the election at the polling booths where so many cities are corrupt. And you see that. And voter fraud is all too common. And then they criticize us for saying that. And we have even Republicans, "Oh, that's such a terrible thing to say."  Well, take a look at Philadelphia, what's been going on. Take a look at Chicago, take a look at St. Louis. Take a look at some of these cities where you see things happening that are horrendous. And if you talk about them, they say bad things about you. They call you a racist. They call you all—and by the way, speaking of that, nobody will do more for the African-American citizens of this country than Donald Trump, nobody, nobody. Nobody will do more for the Latino community than Donald Trump, I can tell you. In 2014, the Washington Post, another beauty, published an article entitled, "Could Non-Citizens Decide the November Election?" The article found that 14 percent of non-citizens were registered to vote, 14 percent were registered to vote. And we're not supposed to talk about it. And your Republican leaders said, "Oh, this—everything is peachy-dory," right? And it also found non-citizen voting may have given Democrats the pivotal sixtieth vote needed to pass Obamacare. It's a Washington policy, not me.  The system is also rigged by the donors giving hundreds of millions of dollars to Crooked Hillary's campaign. It's rigged. It's a bad system. The reason Hillary Clinton pushes for NAFTA—or the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will also be a disaster—NAFTA's the worst trade deal ever signed, ever made, by anybody in the world.  We're a one-way highway out. We get the drugs, right? We get the drugs. We get the unemployment. We get the empty factories. Mexico and other countries get the cash. They get the employment. They get the plants.  And for completely open borders—she wants completely open borders, is because her international donors control her every move. If we let Crooked Hillary's cartel and—and just remember this—run this government, history will record that 2017 was the year that America lost, truly lost, its independence, truly lost its independence.  And by the way, this is our final shot, folks. In four years, it's over. You're never going to be able to win. You're never going to be able to win. It's tilting. It's going to be a one-party system. This is your final shot for the Supreme Court, for your Second Amendment. I mean, this is your final shot, November 8th.  So hopefully you'll do what you know you have to do. Get out of bed and vote. No matter how you're feeling, no matter how you're feeling. It is indeed time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. This is why I'm proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again. First, I'm going to institute a five-year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government after they leave government service, right?  Second, I'm going to ask Congress to institute its own five-year ban on lobbying by former members of Congress and their staffs. That's a simple one. And they know this should be done, but they're not going to do it, but they'll do it if I get in.  I'm going to, number three, expand the definition of lobbyists so that we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves [applause] Right? I've been talking about that for years. Decades of failure in Washington and decades of special interest dealing must and will come to an end. And remember, by the time this ends, I will have spent over $100 million on my campaign. Hillary's spent nothing. She gets all her money from the special interest donors. And my interest is you; my interest is you. [applause] We have to break the cycle of corruption, and we have to give new voices to change. And we have to—we have no—do we have a choice? So that we can have a government that works again and can function properly, which our government doesn't right now, including giving Iran $1.7 billion in cash. [booing] And remember the deportation of 800 people? Turned out to be 800 people, then went to 1,800 people. And they were going to be deported for good reason. You know, if our country deports somebody, they've got to be pretty, pretty out there. Well, they pressed the wrong button, and congratulations, we have 1,800 new citizens of the United States.  And when I said, "undo it," they said that wouldn't be constitutional. Hey, folks, how stupid are we being led? The time for congressional term limits has finally arrived. Not only will it end our government corruption, but we will end the economic stagnation that we're in right now. No growth.  My plan for the economy can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs. It will happen. [applause] At the center of our historic jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals, which I've wanted to do from the beginning; 47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are living right now on food stamps. It's hard to believe this is our country.  We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world. And the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression. Do you know that? The worst since the Great Depression. Colorado has lost one in seven manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA, and a deal supported by Hillary Clinton very strongly.  And this I thought was a typographical error, because I figured they meant 700 or 7,000, but it wasn't: We've lost 70,000 factories since China's entry into the World Trade Organization. Another Bill and Hillary backed disaster.  We are living through the greatest job theft in the history of the world. More jobs have been stolen from our country, so stupidly we let them go. We let our companies go so foolishly. We don't know what we're doing. A Trump administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to the foreign cheating, and stop the jobs from leaving our country, and have jobs come back in the other direction. [applause] As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we're going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent. [applause] We are right now the highest-taxed nation in the world. That's one of the reasons our companies are leaving. We're also going to fix our inner cities—45 percent of African-American children, under the age of six are living in poverty; 58 percent of African-American youth are not working. Almost 3,500 people have been shot in the city of Chicago.  Can you believe this? Since January 1st. The national murder rate has experienced the largest single year increase in more than 45 years. Can you believe that? Murder, highest rate in 45 years.  So you don't—they don't seem to. She said, "nobody cares." And you're right, they don't seem too. So to those African-Americans suffering, to those Latinos suffering, I say: What do you have to lose? Elect Donald Trump. I will fix it. We will fix it. [applause] We will fix it. We're going to get a very big African-American vote. We're going to get a very big Latino vote. Because the Democrats come in, they want your vote. And as soon as you give them the vote, they say, "See you in four years." They don't do anything. It's gotten worse and worse for both the African-Americans, the Latino-Hispanics. It's gotten worse and it will only get worse.  They want your vote. Hillary Clinton said she was going to fix up the state of New York when she ran for the Senate. It is a total disaster. We will be a rich nation once again. But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country. [applause] Our national security begins at the border. Speaking in secret, to a foreign bank [applause] I promise, we will build the wall. [applause] Hillary Clinton said her dream is for total open trade. There go your jobs; and open borders—there goes your country. Simple as that. There are already a record 65 million people in the United States who speak a language other than English. It's in their interest and everyone's interest to control immigration so past arrivals can integrate into society and really join the middle class and the upper class.  But in a secret speech to Goldman Sachs, she said, "Citizens who want to control immigration are un-American." In other words, if you want to have a border, you want to have a wall, which creates a country. Even if you want people to come in, but come in through a legal process, she considers that un-American. So Hillary thinks most of the country is either deplorable, irredeemable, un-American, racist, or basement dwellers in the case of the Bernie Sanders people. She said they were basement dwellers. Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East, meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.  We will be the great Trojan horse folks. As sure as you're standing there. Just today, an Iraqi refugee approved for entry by Hillary Clinton's State Department pled guilty to joining ISIS. He entered as a refugee in November of 2009. And then we approved for a green card in 2011. It's one of hundreds of examples of the United States voluntarily admitting people from the world's most dangerous places who turn out to be terrorists.  So let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected president of the United States, I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorist the hell out of our country. We have enough problems. [applause] We have enough problems. We've got big problems: $20 trillion in debt. We have problems like you wouldn't believe. We'll also stop the crisis of illegal immigration. A Trump administration will secure and defend our borders. And we will build that wall and Mexico will pay for that wall. [applause] We just got the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol Office. First time they've ever done it. ICE was just last week. As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries would not take them back. They were too evil. They were too evil drug lords, heads of gangs. I mean these people were evil. They wouldn't take them back.  So we come over, we bring, they won't take them back. Oh, take them back, drop them on the streets. And then you wonder why the murder rate is the highest in 45 years and other things.  The ICE officer described Hillary's proposal as quote, "The most radical immigration proposal in U.S. history." Here's a summary of the Hillary plan. She wants to support sanctuary cities.  She wants Social Security, Medicare and lifetime welfare for illegal immigrants by making them all citizens. They get taken care of better than our great vets. That won't happen. She wants Obamacare for illegal immigrants. Obamacare is not going to be here much longer, folks. You see what's going on. Regardless. No deportation of Visa overstays. Expanding catch-and-release on the border. She wants it expanded. In other words, catch them and say, "Oh, you can go."  Expanding President Obama's unconstitutional executive amnesty, including instant work permits for millions of illegal workers. Freeing even—there go your jobs—freeing even more criminal aliens by expanding Obama's non-enforcement directives.  And this is to me, the beauty of them all. Obama has allowed thousands and thousands and thousands of people to come in, Syrians from the Middle East. She wants an increase of 550 percent in Syrian refugees into our country. [booing] Either we win this election, or we lose our country. Under a Trump administration, it's going to be America first. [applause] Here are some of the amazing things we're going to do for our country starting in 2017. We're so close. We have to get it over the line. We're so close. Forget the press. Read the internet, study other things, don't go for the mainstream media. Most of them—good news—fortunately most of them won't be around very much longer, in my opinion. They're going down. Financially, big trouble. A lot of big trouble. They've got a lot of big trouble. That's good.  We're going to have—and I do get a lot of honesty over the internet. You do get some dishonesty, too, but at least you can separate it. We should have a choice. We're going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan and maybe even bigger. We're going to eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation. We are going to defend religious liberty, provide school choice to every low- income child in America. And get rid of common core so that we can have education locally. [applause] We are going to support the men and women of law enforcement. [applause] Law and order and justice. Law and order and justice. We are going to save something that is under tremendous stress. We're going to save your Second Amendment. [applause] And we're going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. [applause] You have 21 days to make every dream you've ever dreamed for you family, for your grandchildren, for you children, for yourself, for your country to come true. Our campaign is powered by our love for this country and our love for our fellow citizens. There's a lot of love in this room. A lot of love. And we don't want a divided country. We want to bring other people. We want to love everybody in our country. It's a campaign about rejecting the cynicism and the elitism of our failed political establishment. On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington, D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter. That's you, and you.  I am going to fight so hard for every citizen, of every background, for every single stretch of this nation. I am going to fight for every child living in poverty. I'm going to fight for every mom whose lost her child to illegal immigration and drugs and gang violence, and the viciousness that it all builds.  I'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have turned into dust. And those jobs and factories are not with us any more. They're in other countries, making everybody rich but us. [applause] I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people, not the donors and the special interests. [applause] And with all the money she made, she doesn't put up any money into her own campaign. That's pretty remarkable. I'm doing it. I'm going to fight to bring us all together. We're not going to be divided anymore as Americans. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people, under one God, saluting one American flag. [applause] Thank you. In 10 years, in 20 years, in 30 years, you're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this beautiful day in this great state and in this truly great country. This is a movement that they have never seen before. They've never seen anything like this before. There has never been like this before.  You're going to look back at this election and say, "This is by far the most important vote, you've ever cast, for anyone at any time." [applause] Once again, we're going to have a government of, by, and for the people. [applause] You will see, and be so proud of your country again and hopefully you'll be so proud of your president again. [applause] We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, everybody. God bless you. November 8th, go out and vote. November 8th. God bless you, everybody. [applause]
t65.txt:Thank you. [applause]  Thank you very much. [applause] We love New Hampshire, I can tell you that. [applause] I need to open with a very critical breaking news announcement. [applause] The FBI has just sent a letter to Congress informing them that they have discovered new e-mails pertaining to the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's investigation  Audience: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! And they are reopening her case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United States of America. [applause] Hillary Clinton's corruption is on a scale we have never seen before. We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office. I have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the Department of Justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made. [applause]  This was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understood. And it is everybody's hope that it is about to be corrected. [applause] So that is a big announcement that I heard 10 minutes ago and I guess obviously most of you folks have heard about, and in all fairness for all of the people that have suffered for doing so much less, including just recently four-star General James Cartwright, General Petraeus and many others. Perhaps finally justice will be done. [applause]  With that being said, the rest of my speech is going to be so boring. Should I even make the speech? We will talk about borders, right? We will talk about trade. We'll bring back our jobs, we'll strengthen our military and let's get going, OK? [applause]  I want to thank General Flynn, he's a great general and I want to thank you for being here, General. Thank you very much. Just before General Flynn was going up we heard this news. I said, "General get up there and keep them busy. We want to digest what just happened here." Thank you General.  In 11 days we are going to win New Hampshire [applause] the state of my first victory. And we are going to win back the White House. [applause] Seventy-five percent of the American people think our country is on the wrong track and we are going to fix it. We are going to get our country back on the right track, and very, very quickly. Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare [applause]  We can't forget how big a news that is, we can't lose track. It's a disaster, just like everything else in this administration. It has just been announced that Americans are going to experience another massive double-digit hike in Obamacare premiums, including a 116 percent premium hike to our very good friends in the great state of Arizona. Even Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is the craziest thing in the world, where people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half.  In Minnesota, where the premium increase will be almost 60 percent, the Democratic governor said the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare [booing] admitted it was all a fraud and he said it was passed because of the stupidity of the American voter. Hey, we're doing a lot of good work, aren't we? We're catching all of these people. We're doing a good job. Jonathan Gruber, there's another. See, we didn't forget. I never forgot Jonathan Gruber.  I said you know, if I do this, we're going to run and his name came up and people forget after a week or two. I said I am never going to forget Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare and what he said. So we did not forget. Almost can you imagine, it's like a little more than a week before the election. We didn't forget the name Jonathan Gruber.  But the only real stupidity is that shown by our politicians who passed this monstrosity over the furious objection of certain politicians and the American voter. Job-killing Obamacare is just one more way the system is rigged. What I've just announced previously it might not be as rigged as I thought. Right? Right? [applause]  The FBI I think they're going to right the ship, folks. I think they're going to right the ship. [applause] And they're going to save their reputation by doing so. Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare, destroying American health care forever. She wants to expand Obamacare and make it even more expensive. I will repeal and replace Obamacare and we will replace it with a much less expensive plan and a plan that is much, much better. [applause] Just this year, Hillary Clinton declared Obamacare is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, the Democratic Party and our country. Well, that was that's turned out to be wrong. Do they do anything right? We don't win anymore. We don't I mean, you're going to have such a good time starting in '17. We're going to start winning again. We're going to start winning again. [applause]  Because it's turned out, and I've been saying this from before it passed, Obamacare is a catastrophe beyond imagination. Insurers are leaving, doctors are quitting, companies are fleeing, workers' hours are being cut, part-time jobs are all over the place. Those beautiful full-time jobs that you used to have don't exist and deductibles are through the roof. You don't get to use it. We don't get rid of Obamacare, we have no choice. But if we don't get rid of it, our health care system is gone forever. We'll never have another chance.  And by the way, if we don't win this election, you're never going to have another chance either, that I can tell you. Never going to happen again. Repealing Obamacare is one of the single most important reasons we must win on November 8th. [applause]  But real change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington, and again, maybe that's happened. Wow. We have a big day. [applause] No think of it, I won my first primary in New Hampshire and I am getting here and the news this morning is this is bigger than Watergate. This is bigger than Watergate in my opinion. This is bigger than Watergate [applause]  Hillary bleached and deleted 33,000 e-mails after receiving a congressional subpoena. That alone to me there were more serious things done, but how does it get much more? But that was so obvious. She gets the subpoena and she bleaches and deletes 33,000 e-mails. That to me because it was so simple, you know? Not it's not about the sale of the uranium that nobody knows what it means I know what it means to Russia. Then she talks to me about Russia. 20 percent of the uranium in our country to Russia.  But you know, the deletion of 33,000 e-mails, boy, that just sort of is so out there, after receiving a subpoena from the United States government. She lied to Congress, she lied to the FBI, she made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer. The Clinton crew gave more than $675,000 to the wife of the deputy director of the FBI [booing] and the man who was overseeing the investigation into Hillary's illegal server, but maybe that takes care of itself. Right now that takes care of itself I think, I think. Very proud that the FBI was willing to do this actually, really, very proud. [applause]  Just yesterday we learned that Bill Clinton's right-hand man pushed for Clinton's foundation donors and other large corporations to funnel as much as $66 million in personal profit to Bill and Hillary Clinton.  This man explained that the cozy relationship between his consulting firm to foundation and Clinton's personal income had helped Bill and Hillary enrich themselves, and obtain in-kind services, including personal travel, hospitality, vacations, and the like. [booing]  The same people paying Bill Clinton for speeches were lobbying Hillary Clinton at the same the same time, same time. [booing] And these people are seriously corrupt. [booing] Terribly conflict. Hillary's pay for play included defense contracts. Take Raytheon, when the contractor wanted big foreign arms deals, they hired three lobbyists that raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Hillary's last campaign, and are raising money for her current campaign.  And by the way 50 to 1 in ads, 50 to 1. And if you look at Florida, we're winning. Ohio, we're winning. Iowa we're winning. [applause] Doing great in New Hampshire. I think we're going to have a tremendous victory in Pennsylvania. [applause] We better have a great victory in New Hampshire, please. OK, we will. [applause] In fact when this news when this news of the FBI's investigation, when it just happened a little while ago, they said Mr. Trump, I think they'd understand, we could skip your speech in New Hampshire this is so big. I said I don't have the courage to skip the speech in New Hampshire. Believe me, I don't have the courage. [applause]  I'm not skipping New Hampshire, I never will. You know, when I won, and you remember because I go around and we had the big rallies, and they said oh, the big rallies will never work in New Hampshire, you have to sit down and have dinner with everybody. I said that's like that's a lot of dinners. They don't expect that.  But you remember when we met, and I'd have a lot of small meetings too with people, we'd talk, and New Hampshire more than any other place taught me about drugs flowing into this country. And your police department, so great, the police departments in New Hampshire, they told me. I went to some, I became friendly with some. [applause]  And I never knew I never knew, honestly, I knew it was bad, I never knew it was so bad. And I said to the people of New Hampshire, because more than any other place, you look at the beautiful little roadways and lakes and streams, and everything is so beautiful, the trees, and you say how could they have a drug problem here? It doesn't fit.  But I'd sit down with groups, and I said what's your biggest problem? And I figured they'd say maybe the veterans which are suffering greatly in this area, we understand that. But it was always -- and we'll solve that problem. But it was always, you know what, it was always heroine. I'd say heroine? What do you mean? And I learned so much. And I said to the people of New Hampshire that if I win, which I did with New Hampshire, if I win, and I also said and if I go all the way, we are going to stop the inflow of drugs into New Hampshire and into our country 100 percent [applause] And I gave the people of New Hampshire my pledge, more than anybody else in this case, because they really taught me about what's happening with the world of drugs pouring in. Hard to believe. It's just so, so strange when you look and see the beauty of this place and then you see that heroin and drugs are your number one problem, by far.  Anyway, with months these lobbyists sealed over $26 billion in foreign arms deals, including over $19 billion in Qatar, some people would say Qatar, which happened to be off Bill Clinton. $1 million as a birthday gift for a few minutes of face time. $1 million. The lobbyists, one of whom was the sister-in-law to Hillary Clinton's current campaign chairman, received hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees, the contractor got billions of dollars in contracts, and Hillary Clinton got her campaign cash and money for her foundation.  And you know I'm putting up tremendous amounts of money. Today I wrote another check for $10 million. I'm spending money like crazy. I'll probably have over maybe close to or over $100 million of my money spent on the campaign. But there's something nice about that. Unless I lose, in which case I say, "What was that all about?" But we're gonna do what's right for you, not what's right for some contributor or special interest. [applause]  Hillary put the office of the secretary of state up for sale and if she ever got the chance, believe me she would put the office and you know what office I'm talking about the office called the Oval Office up for sale too. I propose a contract with the American voter which will end corruption and give government back to our great people. I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and heed the words I'm about to say, and I never loved this expression but now I love it because it's become it's become the hottest expression. If we win on November 8th, we are going to Washington, D.C. when we win, OK and we are going to drain the swamp. [applause]  At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. You've been suffering with the jobs. The jobs have gone like candy being taken from a baby. New growth numbers just released put the average growth rate for this year at a disastrous 1.5 percent. If China goes down to 7 or 8 percent GDP, you know it's like a national catastrophe. Last quarter we were at 1 percent. Our job numbers last week were horrible. They were anemic, as the expression goes. They like to say anemic, that was the word they used. Obama is the first president in modern history not to have a single year of 3 percent growth.  And they say it's hard because we're a large county. Well India is a much larger country and they're at 8 percent. China is at 7 percent. And China's not happy. So we're at around 1 percent and we just keep going along, just keep going along losing our jobs to Mexico and every other place. Forty-seven million Americans are on food stamps, and 45 million people think of it, this is our country are living in poverty.  Meanwhile our trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 billion a year. You say, "Who negotiates these contracts?" We're living through Obama. It's true. You know instead of campaigning for Hillary Clinton he ought to be in the White House in the Oval Office negotiating trade deals, beating ISIS, taking care of our veterans which he does not do. We're living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. They're stealing our jobs. Greatest in the history of the world. New Hampshire has lost one in three manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported strongly by Hillary. We've lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary disaster.  The Trump administration will immediately begin negotiating and we will start this negotiation so fast. We will start a negotiation on NAFTA, and if we don't get the deal we want, we will terminate NAFTA and get a much, much better trade deal. [applause]  And I won't go into the details, but because they're different tax systems, they're under a VAT system and we're under our system, but because of the fact that they're under a much different tax system, the day the deal was signed it was a defective deal, with us having a massive, at least 17 percent disadvantage.  So it's complicated. I'm not going to bother you or bore you with it, but we've been working with a defective deal for years, and nobody, no politician ever went back to renegotiate it. We're going to get it done, folks, so easily. [applause]  If a company wants to fire their workers and go to Mexico or another country and then they think they're going to ship their products back into the United States, we will charge them a tax of 35 percent. [applause]  So when you think these companies, which right now are out there negotiating to leave here, they'll leave New Hampshire, they'll leave Pennsylvania, they're gonna leave Ohio, they're gonna leave all of these places, all of our great places and great states. And right now as we're talking, they're negotiating deals.  Mexico is the eighth wonder of the world in terms of the new plants. A friend of mine, Bill Plante, he's the biggest, he said the eighth wonder of the world what's happening in Mexico. And I say, and I tell this to people, what about us? He said meh, not gonna be it's gonna be the other way around. [applause]  But there will be consequences. And you know, when they realize that they've got to now pay a tax, all of that, to come through our very strong border, because there will be a strong border [applause] with their product, you know what they're gonna say? They're gonna say let's say, we're not gonna move, and they're gonna stay. It's very simple. But the politicians don't want to do that because they're controlled they're controlled by the people that give them their campaign contributions and probably other things. We will does anybody know what I mean by that? [applause] We will also stand up to Chinese currency manipulation and we will stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership. [applause] We will become a rich nation again, but to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. Hillary Clinton unleashed ISIS onto the world and it has now spread into our country. There are right now 1,000 open ISIS investigations across the United States, more than at any time that we've ever had. Now, Hillary wants to increase by 550 percent [booing] the massive number of Syrian refugees flowing into our country. That's over the Obama numbers, and those are thousands and thousands of people. A Trump administration will suspend the Syrian refugee program. [applause]  And we'll help them will safe havens and we'll get other countries over there, like the Gulf states who have nothing but money, we have $20 trillion in debt. We'll get them to pay, they gotta do their share. We'll lead it, we'll help, they'll pay, but you know what? We can't let people into this country that we don't know about we don't know. [applause]  Let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected president, I am going to keep [applause]  When... [applause]  We love New Hampshire, I love this place. I love this place. By the way, you know, we're leading in Florida, we're leading in all these places. The recent poll said we're two down in New Hampshire. You know what I said? I don't think so, I don't think so. [applause]  These polls, these polls, these are called dirty polls, you know what that is? These are false. I don't think so. She comes up here, she has four people, and it's like oh, we have a wonderful crowd. I don't think so. I think we're winning New Hampshire big. OK. So we'll change it. When I'm elected president [applause] I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. [applause] A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. Boy, you people have energy, you're great. [applause] Well, let's face it, it's been a long time, right? It's been a long time. You've been waiting a long time for the right person, but you do have energy. You know what's happening? A lot of these places A lot of the different places, reports are coming out. They hate to write it, you know the dishonest media. [booing] But people by the way, great people, oh they're the worst, they're so dishonest. They are so dishonest, folks. But a lot of these reports coming out in the early voting states, people are coming up that have never voted. These are great Americans, these are great people, but they've just never seen anybody that they wanted to like they've never heard people say we're going to actually bring back your jobs. We're not going to let companies leave us and fire everybody and move and then let the product pour into our country with no tax.  No, no, just go ahead, leave, fire all our people, move to Mexico, make the product, sell your air conditioners Carrier's an example, they're leaving they might not leave, they're probably all about ready to change their mind. But just let your product come right in, no tax, no nothing. I mean, how stupid is this? How stupid?  And I'm a free-trader, I'm a fair trader. But we have the wrong people represent us. So what's happening is these lines in Florida are four blocks long. They were never like that. They've never seen anything like it. And in Tennessee, a great congressman, been there for 25 years, said to me, "I've never seen we have never seen anything like it." [applause]  People are coming out that haven't voted in years. People are coming out, they literally they hadn't voted in years. So they're not polled because, you know, unless you voted like in the last election, they don't want to poll you. So, people are coming out that hadn't voted in years. Happening in Texas. They haven't voted in years.  And people that have never even voted, and yet they're great Americans. They just never saw somebody that they wanted to vote for. And they're coming out and they've got the Trump shirt and they've got the hat, they've got buttons all over the place, you know. [applause]  Now, who knows who knows? They may have all of the Trump stuff and you never know. Maybe they're voting for crooked Hillary Clinton, but I don't think so, right? I don't think so. [booing] History has taught us that we don't think so. So, I think we're doing great. And yes, on the border, we have no choice, we will build a wall and Mexico will pay for the wall. Got to stop the drugs. [applause] Got to stop the drugs. Remember my pledge to everybody but in particular to New Hampshire, because I know what you're going through with the drugs. I know what your incredible law enforcement, your police and your fire departments, because I see where they're helping so much. Believe me, they're they're not spoken about.  And how about where they're shooting? During fires, they're shooting at the firemen. Now, this is a new phenomenon. They're shooting at firemen. They're shooting bullets at firemen going to fires and fighting fires. So we have a divided country and we're going to make our country love again. We're going to bring it like this room. [applause]  Countless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this administration. This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root. You've heard that story, you've seen it, you've read about it.  The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody and then was released into the United States community under the policies of this White House. He was released again and again, after crime after crime and now is at large. Sarah graduated from college just the day before with a 4.0 grade point average, top in her class. She was violently, violently killed. Outstanding young woman. I know her parents; they're incredible. Also among the victims of Obama-Clinton open borders policy was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21-year-old convenience store clerk in Mesa, Arizona. He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from federal custody. And so many people said please, please, please don't release him, he's violent. And he shot Grant through the head.  Another victim who we've all read about and known about, Kate Steinle, gunned down in the sanctuary city of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant. [booing] And this person was deported five previous times. And now, he's got a good lawyer and the case will go on and on and on. He's got a lawyer, I see them in court all the time. The case will go on and on. Shot in the back while standing with her father. Great parents, great brother.  Then there is the case of 90-year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long but who did not meet the Obama administration's priorities for removal. People begged that they be incarcerated or be moved out of the country, but our geniuses wouldn't listen.  In California, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never deported. People asked please, please deport him. This is what happened. This is a crime wave that never ends. I can tell you it's thousands of cases like this.  When I'm president, believe me, it will end. [applause] Not only will a wall keep out the dangerous cartels and criminals, but will also keep out the drugs, remember New Hampshire, and the heroin poisoning our youth. Our youth is being poisoned before they get a chance [applause]  And by the way, I've met plenty of people in New Hampshire that are not our youth that have a tremendous problem, and I want to tell you, we're going to work with people, we're going to set up programs, we're going to try everything we can to get them unaddicted, unaddicted. [applause]  So as I said, when I won the New Hampshire primary, I promised the people of New Hampshire that we would stop drugs from pouring into your community and I guarantee you we will. You will be so proud of your president, you will be so proud of your community. [applause]  You will be so proud. I just want to say in closing I just want to say in closing that we have an amazing movement going on. A movement like they've never seen before, a movement that hopefully won't be stopped. We have a movement that the biggest people in the world of the media, the biggest, have said they've never seen anything like it before. Every every crowd, every auditorium.  The other night, we had a situation. We had thousands and thousands of people and I said to the fire marshal, isn't it possible to let more in? We had thousands of people in this massive field and we had many thousands outside of the gates they wouldn't let in and I said, couldn't we let them in? And they said, we can't. I said, but there's no fire, we're outside. He said, it's stampede, Mr. Trump, we're worried about a stampede.  And it's a stampede of love. It's true. It's not a stampede it's a stampede of love. [applause] Because there was so many people. They said we have very strong security guards, but Mr. Trump, they're not nearly strong as 45,000 people come charging forward. So I fully understood it. But we have something going on that's so special. It's so special. We're going to reduce your taxes, we're going to simplify your taxes. We're going to make your businesses welcome in our country. [applause]  We're going to reduce the taxes for middle-income people. We call them the forgotten men and women. Greatly simplify your returns. The only company that I can think of that won't like us is H&R Block, they will not like us. They're not gonna like Trump too much. But we'll greatly simplify your taxes. And your businesses we're taking it from 35 percent, which is one of the highest in the world, just about the highest, down to one of the lowest in the world, 15 percent. [applause]  We're getting rid of a lot of the regulations that are stopping growth. Tremendous amounts of regulation are killing your small businesses and your big businesses. So we're gonna have a very tax- friendly country again, and it's gonna mean jobs, it's gonna mean expansion, it's gonna mean new companies growing.  We are going to create the border. We are going to stop the drugs. We're gonna have people come into our country. We want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally. They have to come in through a legal process. We want a lot of people to come in. [applause]  And they're going to come in, but they'll come in legally. And we're gonna streamline the process. People are waiting on line now 10 years. We're gonna streamline because we want people to come in, but we want them to come in legally. And we want merit, too. We want to take wonderful, great people that love our country, they want to get out and they want to do a great job. We want to have them also come in based on merit. A word you don't hear anymore. A word you don't hear any more. It's too bad.  We're also going to very importantly appoint justices to the Supreme Court [applause] Who you can be proud of and who will respect the Constitution of the United States. [applause] We're going to save our Second Amendment, which is under unbelievable siege. [applause]  We're going to help big league on education, we're going to go with choice, so important, and we're going to terminate Common Core and bring education local. [applause]  Our military is depleted. We're going to rebuild our military. We are going to lead through strength. [applause] And hopefully, we're not gonna have to use our military but I will say this. We're getting rid of ISIS. We're getting rid of ISIS. [applause] ISIS is we have no choice. By the way, not since medieval times has anyone seen chopping off of heads, drowning in steel cages, burying in sand. Not since not since medieval times. It all grew during the tenure of Obama and Hillary Clinton.  ISIS you know she stands up and she says what she's gonna do. Well, she was there. It came out of the vacuum because we should have never gone into Iraq, but once we did, we should have gone out the right way, not the wrong way. And the way they went out was so bad, so bad, including giving back Mosul, which now they're fighting to take back. And it would have been nice the element of surprise. Do we agree? Does anybody not agree? [applause]  The element of surprise. We don't use the element of surprise. We use the element of tell them everything we can possibly tell them, give them plenty of time to get ready and then attack. And it turns out to be a lot tougher than they ever thought.  But we're going to have a country that you're going to be proud of again. We're going to have a president that hopefully you will be proud of. [applause] I will work so hard for every community. I'll be working very hard for the African-American community, for the Hispanic community. I'll be working hard for every community. And we're gonna have this divided nation come together. And I just want to say we're gonna make America strong again, we're gonna make America doesn't sound nice, but we have no choice wealthy again. [applause]  But we are going to make America great again. [applause] And I want to thank everybody in New Hampshire. Get out and vote. You're very special people. You're very, very special people. God bless you, get out and vote. [applause] Thank you. Thank you, New Hampshire. [applause]
t70.txt:Thank you, everybody, thank you. Wow. These crowds. [applause] These crowds are terrific. Thank you very much. In six days, we are going to win the great state of Florida. And we are going to win back the White House. That will happen. But you have to get out, you have to vote, we have to get out there. We don't want to blow it.  That I can tell you because we have worked very hard, all of us, you, me, everybody. And it's very historic what's happening. I'd like to begin today by thanking all of you for joining me. This has been an incredible journey and we've all done it together. We're almost at the end. [applause] But we're really at the end of the beginning if you think about it. Aren't we? The end of the beginning. Our magnificent history movement has surprised the world and defied expectations at every single turn.  And now, next Tuesday, we will have one last glorious surprise for the pundits, the politicians and the special interests and return the power back to the people. It's going to happen. [applause] It's going to happen. It's been the honor of my life share this journey with you, it has absolutely been. [applause] There are two people, however, who I did not really get to share this with but who are in my thoughts often. And that's my mother and my father, great people. [applause] I had great parents. Great parents. I know they're up there watching, I just felt that nice breeze. It's hot, but I just felt that nice breeze [applause] So they're helping us out. And I just want to say thank you to both of them. Special, special people. I've had a great life and now I want to give back to the country that I love. It's time, we have to we have to give back, folks [applause] I've seen how the career of politicians, the big donors and the special interests have bled this country dry and stripped our middle class and stripped our companies of its jobs and its wealth. But we're just six days away from delivering justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this country[applause] Justice for every child trapped in poverty in the inner cities, for every family that's born—and you know that, they've been born into a situation in some case; they can't get out of it. We're going to get them out of it. We're going to get them out of it.  We have endless wars. Every community's hopes and dreams have been shattered and we're not going to let that happen. Our inner cities are going to come back and they're going to come back strong and your going to see what I mean. [applause] And the African-American community and the Hispanic community are really understanding what's going on and you see that right now. You see that right now in what's happening at the polls.  We're winning in Florida, we're winning in Ohio, we're winning in Iowa, in North Carolina. We're doing great in Pennsylvania. A lot of people are saying Pennsylvania's looking very good. So many different places.  We just got a poll with three up in Virginia. [applause] But we are seriously up in Florida. That's very important [applause] And I will never, ever let you down. Real change begins immediately with repealing and replacing Obamacare, a disaster. [applause] A disaster. [applause] It is a disaster. It's just been announced that the residents of Florida are going to experience a massive double digit premium hike. [booing] I will not tell you what the number is. I know the number very well, but I want you to leave happy. You don't want to hear the number, go home, relax, wake up good and strong tomorrow morning. You'll learn, you're not going to like it.  In the great state of Arizona, where we just left, the premiums are going up more than 116 percent. [booing] Over 90 percent of the counties in Florida and by the way, in the primaries, I won 66 out of 67 primaries. That's good. [applause] I was going to try and exaggerate and say I won them all, but I can't do that. Over 90 percent of the counties in Florida are losing Obamacare insurers next year, they're leaving. They're all leaving.  In Minnesota where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic governor has said the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. Obamacare is a total catastrophe.  Yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive. [booing] I'm asking for your vote so we can replace Obamacare and save healthcare for every family in Florida, so important. [applause] Real change also means restoring honesty to our government. [applause] As you know, the FBI has reopened its investigation into crooked Hillary Clinton. [applause] Hillary wants to blame everyone else for amounting legal troubles and I don't see if you've watched her last few speeches over the last few days. She has become totally unhinged, unbelievable.  What she's saying and what she's doing is actually, it's unbelievable. But she has no one to blame but herself. Hillary is the one who set up the illegal private e-mail server to shield her criminal activity.  Hillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt pay for play scheme at the State Department. Hillary is the one who lied so many times to Congress and to the FBI. Hilary is the one who made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer and who destroyed 33,000 e-mails after, after, after, after receiving a congressional subpoena, think of that. [booing] Unbelievable. [booing] And as you know, they just found—listen to this and I guess you know it, 650,000 e-mails. [booing] And I would say that classified, confidential, I think they're probably all over the place. I think they're—I think they're gonna find a treasure trough. I can't even imagine.  In fact, they said well, this is OK they're duplicates. How could there be duplicates when its many more times what we thought was stolen in the first place, right?  You know, when they deleted 33,000 I thought that was a lot. They have 650,000? Hillary is the one who accepted debate questions given to her in advance and used them to cheat. [booing] Instead of reporting the breach. That's a big deal. You know, to me that's a big deal. Some people say oh, that's fine, that's a big deal. That's really—that's a real cheater, OK? That's a cheater.  And she was given the questions by a woman that frankly should resigned from the DNC or be fired. [applause] But that's a really big deal. And you notice, they never—the dishonest prospect, the most dishonest. [booing] If you notice, they never go after Hillary. They always talk about Donna Brazile, Donna Brazile didn't do it. But can you imagine if I got—can you imagine, they gave the questions to Donald Trump before a debate. [applause] You know it would be the electric chair. They'd reinstitute the electric chair. No. It'd be headlines all over the world. This isn't headlines. I bring it up; it's brought up a little bit. But this isn't like a big deal. She got the debate questions and answers. But she got the debate questions prior to a debate. Now, Bernie Sanders should be angry right? Shouldn't he be angry? Now, I'll tell you what. The system is rigged. The system is rigged. I've been saying it for a—it's rigged, and we're gonna straighten it out. But the system is rigged. Hillary is not the victim; the American people are the victims of this system. [applause] So corrupt in so many ways. And this is your one chance to change it because you know what? In four years, not gonna happen. There's no way. The numbers won't work. In four years, there's no way. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency. And if she were to be elected, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis.  I mean before you go into phase two—let's call what happened on Friday phase two. Phase one, she's so guilty. She shouldn't be allowed to run for the presidency.  That's why I say the system is rigged. She shouldn't be allowed to run. But I have a feeling in the 650,000 e-mails, they're gonna find things that you will not even believe.  Who knows. 650,000 e-mails. No wonder she can't do anything. No, no. How do you work? How do you do it? 650,000. They'll have to explain that to us some day. But they'll have some things in there that I can just imagine are going to be unbelievable. Hillary's likely to be under investigation for many years. Probably concluding in a criminal trial.  Out today, WikiLeaks just came out with a new one. Just a little while ago. It's just been shown that a rigged system with more collusion, possibly illegal between the Department of Justice, the Clinton campaign, and the State Department.  You saw that. The e-mails show that the Assistant Attorney General who's involved in the investigation has been feeding information directly to John Podesta and the Clinton campaign. Can you believe this? [booing] She shouldn't be allowed to run. By the way, behind me, the great Johnny Damon. The curse of the Yankees, but ultimately he helped the Yankees. Johnny Damon. Stand up Johnny. [applause] Now, I'll tell ya. George Steinbrenner was a good friend of mine. Oh, he didn't like Johnny too much. Then he ultimately signed him and then he was fine. He did great. But Johnny Damon was a champ. He was a winner. And he loves this area, you know that. My contract with the American voter begins with a tough ethics reform, and it ends—I'll tell you what. We are going to end—we have no choice.  We really have no choice—government corruption. It's going to end. [applause] I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we all will say right now when we win on November 8. We are going to Washington, D.C. and we are going to drain the swamp. [applause] At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. Florida has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton with the support of crooked Hillary. [booing] America has lost—this is so hard to believe—70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization. Another Bill and Hillary backed disaster. We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America, and we will stop the jobs from leaving Florida. They're leaving. We're going to stop it And you have an excellent governor, by the way. He's fighting hard for you folks. I don't know—I don't know. All I can tell you is he is a worker, he is a worker, and he's fighting very hard. The theft of American prosperity will end and it'll end, I'll tell you. We are—it is being stolen from us folks.  It is—we have a one-way highway right into Mexico, right into other countries. And we're going to stop it. From now on, it's going to be America first. [applause] America first. [applause] It's going to be America first. [applause] A Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA and we will stand up to foreign product dumping, currency manipulation, and all of the unfair subsidy behaviors. It's horrible what's happening to us. Our politicians don't have a clue, they don't know what they're doing—or other things, OK. We will also immediately stop the job killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. As part of our plan to bring back jobs, we're going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent. We're the highest taxed nation in the world. Killing our jobs. Our companies are leaving. Killing our jobs.  We will become a rich nation once again. But to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. In Orlando, the murder rate doubled, you know that? Doubled last year. Can you believe it? We will support our police, and I met you police of Orlando, they are unbelievable people and they've been through a lot.  I met the police and these are unbelievable people. We will bring this crime wave to an end. We will also keep our community safe from terrorism. Just a short time ago, Orlando was the victim of the worst mass shooting in American history during the Islamic terror attack on The Pulse nightclub.  It was also the worst attack on the LGBTQ community in our country's history. Can't let it happen, can't let it happen. Hillary wants to increase by 550 percent Syrian refugees pouring into our country. [booing] Her plan would mean generations of terrorism, radicalism, and extremism spreading in your schools and throughout your communities.  When I'm elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refuge program. [applause] And we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of your community. [applause] Got to keep them out. And we'll build safe zones in Syria. We have to help the people. We're going to build safe zones, but the Gulf States haven't been doing their thing.  And believe me, they have plenty of money. They'll help us, they'll fund it, I'm sure they'll be thrilled. They're going to be funding it, and that will be OK. We want to help people. But we have enough problems in this country. We don't need Orlando and problems. We don't need what happened in San Bernadino.  We don't need what's happening in Paris, in Nice and in Germany—which is a disaster. We don't need it. We have enough problems right now, do we agree? We have enough problems. We don't need it. A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. [applause] And yes, we will build a great wall. [applause] We received the first ever endorsement from our ICE and border patrol officers, great people. The officers that warned that Hillary's plan is the most quote, radical immigration proposal in United States history, and that it will lead to the loss of thousands and thousands of lives, quote.  As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free because their home countries were intelligent, they wouldn't take them back. We bring them to their countries—murderers, drug dealers, gang members, we'd bring them to their countries and their countries would say: get them out, we're not taking them back. They call up the State Department, and the State Department under Hillary Clinton would say: oh, bring them back, we don't want to make waves.  I guarantee you, whether it's four years or eight years, that will not happen once under a Trump administration. [applause] Hillary wants totally open borders and strongly supports sanctuary cities. Like San Francisco, where Kate Steinle—incredible young woman—was murdered by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times.  A Trump administration will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities immediately. We will end illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens—the ones we just spoke about—and we will save American lives. We will also repeal Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our very badly depleted military. [applause] That includes major new investments in resources from Pensacola Naval Air Station at MacDill Air Force Base. Have you ever heard of those places? Pretty good places. A lot of people here, lot of people. I'm honored to have the endorsement of 200—more than that now, much more than that—top Admirals and Generals and 22 Medal of Honor recipients.  Great people, I've met so many of them, they're incredible. Incredible people. Our new foreign policy will put America first. Hillary and our failed Washington establishment have spend $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East that we never won and that never end. And it's now in worse shape than ever before.  The Middle East is a catastrophe, it's far worse off than had we spent nothing. They've dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe. They've left our borders wide open at home. And they've shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries. And it's—it's disappearing. Our country, in a certain sense, is disappearing. Prosperity—real prosperity is disappearing. We owe $20 trillion. Our trade deals, we lose $800 billion a year on trade. We have trade deficits. Think of that. Who negotiates these deals?  You know who does? Stupid people. Stupid people. [applause] With very stupid leadership. Who, by the way, they campaign all the time. He's campaigning right now for crooked Hillary. [booing] Why is he campaigning? She's under federal investigation, and we've got a president campaigning for her. And that's all he does is campaign. He ought to be working on your jobs that are leaving and going to Mexico. And your military. [applause] I'll tell you what, first of all, she's got bigger problems. But four more years of Obama, we can't take it, folks. Four more years of ISIS, that's what it is. Four more years of no jobs.  Now, she wants to start a shooting war in Syria and conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia that could very well lead to World War III. Russia is heavily armed, doesn't like her. Putin does not respect her, doesn't like her. What are we doing, folks? She's a mess.  To all Americans, I say it's time for new leadership. [applause] Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. [applause] Thank you. It's so beautiful over there. I just noticed the water. Let's go in for a swim. It's about 200 degrees out there. Anybody want to go swimming? Let's go. [applause] We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. And Hillary wants to increase your taxes by a tremendous amount. You know, we're already the highest-taxed nation in the world. She wants to increase your taxes, if you can believe that one.  We're going to eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation. Killing your companies. Killing them. One of the reasons they're leaving. Cancel every illegal Obama executive order. [applause] We're going to rebuild our military and take care of our great, great veterans. They're not being taken care of. You know that. A lot of veterans here. We're going to take care of our veterans finally. They have been mistreated for many, many years.  We're going to support the men and women of law enforcement. [applause] We will save the Second Amendment which is, as you know, under tremendous siege. [applause] We will appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. [applause] We will show the world that there is no challenge too great, no dream outside of our reach. There's no dream—no dream outside of our reach. We have all these people telling us what to do. Politicians—they know nothing. I've dealt with them all my life, folks. All talk, no action.  I have some friends that are politicians. So let me just say there's some good ones. OK? There are some good. I'll tell you what, you take a look at the media. These are the most dishonest people anywhere. [booing] These are the most—they—the media—the media is a part and one of the vital cogs in the rigged system under which we live. They're a big fat cog in the—and they never show the crowds. They never show what's happening.  But you know what? You hear—when you hear 20,000, sometimes 30,000, when you hear people, sounds like you're at an Ohio State football game. [applause] But they never show it. They never show it. [applause] They never show it. People of Florida, we love you. All we have to do is cut our ties with these failed politicians of the past. Hillary is a candidate of yesterday. We are the movement of the future. We are. [applause] We're asking for the votes of Republicans, Democrats, independents and first-time voters, of which we're finding out there are many. You probably heard over the last couple of weeks "Texas is in play"; "Texas—that Georgia is in play." And I'm saying, "Gee, that's too bad."  Let me tell you, they're setting records in Texas, and they're voting for Trump, just so you understand that. [applause] And they know it. [applause] But when they see those numbers coming, they don't want to announce them. But we are winning almost everywhere. I think—give us two more days, I think we're going to be winning everywhere. [applause] And I'm almost starting to think that the least important problem that Hillary has is the fact that we're winning. I think she's got perhaps bigger problems than even that. [applause] We're fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and nor Hillary's special interests. [applause] We are fighting to unlock the potential of every American community and every American family who hope and pray and yearn for a much better future. [applause] I am asking you to dream big—I got to dream big. Because with your vote, we are just—can you believe this?—six days away. Think of that. [applause] From the change you've been waiting for your entire life. [applause] We're going to work together. We're going to vote. You're going to vote now or you're going to vote by the 8th. But you're going to vote. Thank you. I love that guy. He's a tough guy, but he just screamed out, "You're going to win." We're going to win. Thank you, man. Thank you. [applause] We have great, great love. You know, we're in a divided nation. We are a divided nation. We're not going to be divided. We're going to have such love in this country. We're going to have such love and such respect.  Together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. [applause] We will make America safe again. [applause] And we will make America great again. [applause] Thank you very much. Thank you, folks. God bless you, everybody. God bless you. [applause] Thank you. Get out and vote. Get out and vote. Thank you. [applause]
t71.txt:Thank you. Thank you. [applause] I love that sign, "Blacks for Trump." I love that sign, thank you. [applause] There are a lot of those signs. Thank you. "Women for Trump." [applause] "Hispanics for Trump." [applause] There's one "Women and Hispanics for Trump." [applause] Thank you very much. In six days, we are going to win the great state of Florida and we are going to win back the White House 100 percent. [applause] We're on the cusp of an incredible historic change that transfers power from a failed political establishment and returns that power to our families, communities and citizens, to you.  The system is rigged, remember that. The system is rigged. Right now it's rigged. We're going to change it. There's some breaking news about that subject that we're going to discuss right now. As I mentioned yesterday, on of the—and you probably saw this and maybe some of you have just read it.one of the top Department of Justice officials involved in the e-mail investigation, Assistant Attorney General Peter Kassig [booing] is a close associate of John Podesta. The two met for dinner after Clinton testified about Benghazi and Podesta, who by the way said Hillary Clinton has terrible instincts on WikiLeaks, described him as the man who kept him, Podesta, out of jail.  Kadzik is also the one who helped lead the effort to confirm Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Now, today, in a newly released e- mail—through WikiLeaks again—we learned that Kadzik was feeding information about the investigation into the Clinton campaign and that [booing] right? And that Kadzik said quote "It will be a while before the State Department posts the e-mails." Remember they were waiting for the e-mails. [booing] Podesta forwarded the e-mails to Clinton's top staff and said, additional chances for mischief. These are the people that want to run our country, folks. [booing] The spread of political agendas into the Justice Department—there's never been a thing like this that has happened in our country's history—is one of the saddest things that has happened to our country. But with your vote you can beat the system, the rigged system, and deliver justice. So, show up early and vote. Show up early. You know, the lines are incredible. The polls are all saying we're going to win Florida. Don't believe it. Don't believe it. Get out there and vote. Pretend we're slightly behind. You got to get—we don't want to blow this.  This is the one chance we have, it'll never happen again. It's not going to happen. In four years, it's not going to happen—it can't happen again. This is a movement like we have never seen in this country before. These crowds, the enthusiasm, the love. [applause] Got to get out and vote. Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. [applause] And Hillary is not going to be the answer because she wants to make it more expensive. She's doubling down. It's just been announced that the residents of Florida—sorry to tell you this, folks—are going to experience a massive, massive double digit premium hike. [booing] Now, I know what that hike is, but I want you to leave here happy, I want you to be happy people. I want you to think about the future after we take back the White House so I'm not going to tell you what your hike is, but let me just say it's going to be very substantial. And Obamacare doesn't work on top of everything else. As an example, in the great state of Arizona—which I just left—premiums are going up more than 116 percent. It's out of control.  Over 90 percent of the counties in Florida are losing Obamacare insurance next year. Lots of luck in your negotiation. In Minnesota where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic governor said, the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. Premiums are surging, companies are leaving, insurers are fleeing, doctors are quitting and deductibles are absolutely through the roof. Wasn't supposed to be like this, but I said it was going to be like this before it was passed because I understand how business works.  Obamacare never had a chance. It's a catastrophe. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare making it even more expensive. It's going to go up a lot. People aren't going to be able to afford it so I'm not sure that it matters, they're just not going to be able to pay. I'm asking for your vote so we can replace Obamacare and save health care for every family in Florida and the United States. [applause] Real change also means restoring honesty to our government. As you know, the FBI has—did you hear about this little event? The FBI re-opening the investigation. [applause] They're re-opening the investigation into Crooked Hillary Clinton. [booing] Crooked Hillary, she's crooked. [booing] Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! She is a crooked one, there's no question. Crooked Hillary Clinton, you know that term has really stuck, everyone's calling her—has anyone seen Crooked Hillary Clinton today? [applause] That's going to be a great term for a president, right? Boy, oh boy, what a mess. This is the biggest scandal since Watergate. And now it's been reported that there are FBI inquiries probing virtually all of Hillary Clinton's inner circle and many of the things she's done over the years. It's about time. Remember, it's a rigged system, remember it's about time.  She wants to blame everyone else for her mounting legal troubles, but she really has no one to blame but herself. Hillary is the one who set up the illegal private e-mail server to shield her criminal activity. The woman screaming exactly, exactly, it is exactly. Hillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt pay-for-play scheme at the State Department and who ripped off the people of Haiti, the people of Haiti were ripped off. [booing] And I met with the people of Little Haiti. Anybody here? These are great people, great, thank you. Hillary is the one who endangered national security by sending classified information on an insecure server. Hillary is the one who lied so many times to Congress and the FBI. Hillary is the one who made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer. [booing] And she's the one who destroyed 33,000 e-mails after receiving a Congressional subpoena. [booing] She also accepted debate questions given to her in advance by Donna Brazile [booing] and then used those debate questions to cheat. It's cheating, the worst level. Instead of reporting this breach to an ethics committee or whoever would listen to the breach. So she got the answers, cheating. She got the questions, cheating. And then she—rather than reporting them, rather than saying this shouldn't be happening—she used them against Bernie Sanders.  Can you imagine. she probably got them against me too except we won the debate so easy I don't think it mattered. We won those debates. [applause] Did you see her at the end of the debates? Folks, she was exhausted. You know what she did? She immediately went home and went to sleep. [applause] Hillary is not the victim, and the American people, frankly, are the victims of this rigged and corrupt system in every way. But this is your chance finally to change it, November 8th. Now in Florida's case, earlier. Now, just so you understand, record turnout, unbelievable numbers, unbelievable. We're doing great with the African-American community. [applause] We're doing great with the Hispanic community. [applause] And the lines are four, five and six blocks long. They've never seen anything like it. And the polls have just come up. We're way up in Florida. I shouldn't say that, because I want you to go vote. [applause] OK, ready? We're going to pretend we're down. We're down. Pretend, right? We'll pretend we're down. No, we got to win. We got to win big. We got to beat her. Got to beat her. We're up in Ohio, we're up in Iowa, we're up in North Carolina. [applause] I think we're doing great in Pennsylvania; from what I hear. [applause] Folks, you're going to be so proud. You're going to be so proud. We're going to make America great again. You're going to be so happy and you're going to be so proud of your country again.  If Hillary Clinton were to be elected, it would create an unprecedented and protracted constitutional crisis. [booing] Haven't we just been through a lot with the Clintons, right? Remember when he was impeached for lying? He can't practice law. He doesn't have the right to practice law. Didn't we just go through this? And the last thing we need is another four years of Obama. That's the last thing. [booing] And this will be worse. That means ISIS, that means high taxes, that means bad health care, that means no border. Without a border, we don't have a country. The work of government would grind to a halt if she were ever elected. She'll be in court for her entire tenure and she'll be convicted. Because look, the first time—I mean, frankly, forget about this time. The first time she gets a subpoena from the United States Congress and she deletes everything? There shouldn't have been a second time.  But I have respect that the FBI has given it a second chance. And this time, I have no doubt that in that 650,000 e-mails—did you see where they said, oh, we're not worried. They're duplicates. How can there be duplicates if there are hundreds of thousands more than you started off with? [booing] So today, I guess WikiLeaks, it sounds like, is going to be dropping some more, and if we met tomorrow, I'll tell you about it tomorrow, but one beauty that's been caught was, and this was just recently, newly released, where they say having a dump. We're having a dump of all of those e-mails. In another communication, Bill Clinton's chief of staff says foreign government—right, this should be another one. Just like swamp—you know the swamp little statement—this one, this one. Do you remember what it is? Right? All the money is in, right? They said all the money is in. They're talking about foreign money pouring into their pockets. They said all the money is in. [booing] This is what is running for office. Honestly, she should be ashamed of herself. She should be ashamed of herself. My contract with the American voter begins with a plan to restore honesty to our government. That includes a ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections. Makes sense. I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we all will be saying right now. When we win on November 8th, we are going to Washington, D.C. and we are going to drain the swamp. [applause] Gonna drain the swamp. We're gonna drain the swamp, folks. We're gonna drain that swamp. [applause] Another important issue for Americans is integrity in journalism. These people are among the most dishonest people I've ever met, spoken to, done business with. These are the most dishonest people. [booing] There has never been dishonesty—there has never been dishonesty like we've seen in this election. There's never been anywhere near the media dishonesty like we've seen in this election. Don't worry, they won't spin the cameras and show the kind of massive crowds. They won't do that. [booing] The very talented Michael Goodwin of the New York Post just wrote today that 2016 presidential race will mark the low-water mark of journalism that is worthy—think of it—of the First Amendment. Never before have so many media organizations, old and new, abandoned all pretense of fairness to take sides and try to pick a president. [booing] It's unbelievable. It's un-honest. For instance, we have a great story. We give it out to the media. They'll make it look as bad as possible—as bad as possible. Parenthetically So sad. Parenthetically and very sadly, earnings for the New York Times are down 97 percent this year. They just announced that. So bad. I feel so badly for them. Just announced—97 percent. Oh, they're doing great. And then they tell you who to vote for, you know? Who to vote for. They want crooked Hillary.  This isn't about me; it's about all of you and our magnificent movement to make America great again all over this country. And they're talking about it all over the world.  At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back jobs. [applause] Right now, 70 million American women and children live in poverty or near the brink of poverty. Forty-three percent of African- American school-aged children live in poverty. Thirty-two percent of Hispanic school-aged children live in poverty.  This is America, this is the United States, this is unacceptable. As your president, I will go into the poorest communities and work on a national plan for revitalization. [applause] We will replace decades of failure with generations of success. Florida has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary. [booing] And here's a number that you should remember because it's not even a believable number, and it's correct. America has lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization. Another Bill and Hillary-backed disaster.  We are living through the greatest jobs left in the history of the world. Our jobs are going to Mexico, our jobs are going to other countries. China and others are making our product. We don't make it anymore. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America and we will stop the jobs from leaving Florida. [applause] My second home, you know that, I'm here all the time. My second home, great place. The theft of American prosperity will end. So they are stealing our prosperity, horribly stealing our prosperity. A Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA and we'll stand up to foreign product dumping all over the place. [applause] Currency manipulation by China and many other countries and all of the unfair subsidy behavior that's going on all over the world against us. We will also immediately stop the job-killing, Trans- Pacific Partnership, a disaster. [applause] And Hillary wants it to happen, she called it the gold standard, then she rejected it. But she's going to approve it. Then she lied during the debate, right? She lied. [booing] She lied during the debate. She said she never called it the gold standard, she lied. And she lied about the line in the sand, right? She lied. As part of our plan to bring back jobs, we're going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent. [applause] We will also cancel billions in global warming payments to the United Nations [applause] and use that money to support America's vital environmental infrastructure and natural resources. We're spending hundreds of billions of dollars. We don't even know who's doing what with the money. We're gonna spend the money here. We're gonna work on our own environment. [applause] That includes repairing the Herbert Hoover Dike at Lake Okeechobee and protecting the Florida Everglades. [applause] We will become a rich nation again, but to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation [applause] A terrible tragedy today has occurred in Iowa. You read, you saw. Early this morning, two Iowa police officers, outstanding, outstanding people, were murdered, ambushed, ambushed violently while sitting in their squad cars. We send our thoughts and prayers to the family of the fallen. I just left Iowa, most beautiful place. The treatment was so incredible, the crowds, the police officers were so incredible the job they did. Now two of them are dead. An attack on our police is an attack on all of us. [applause] Law enforcement is the line separating civilization from total chaos, you have to remember that. [applause] According to the national law enforcement officers, Memorial Fund, firearm related police were up 48 percent this year, the highest they've ever been. And there have been 14 ambush style attacks this year alone, never had anything like this.  And what it is, is a lack of respect for our nation, it's a lack of respect for our leadership. To all the great men and women of law enforcement I want you to know, we're with you, we support you and we will stand by you. [applause] We will restore law order and justice in America—justice. [applause] Thank you. Thank you, so good luck to the people of Iowa. We will also work with our federal and local law enforcements to keep America safe from terrorism. [applause] Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees pouring into our countries. [booing] Her plan would mean generations of terrorism and extremism spreading in your schools and all throughout your communities. When I'm president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program[applause] and we will keep radical Islamic terrorist the hell out of your community. [applause] Now, we all have heart and we're gonna build safe zones and we're gonna have some of the Gulf States that have nothing but money, they'll put up the money, we'll lead it, we'll build safe zones.  But we have enough problems in our country. She wants to increase the thousands and thousands that are pouring in right now. She wants to increase that number by 550 percent.  And then, you wonder why Podesta says, she has bad instincts and you wonder why Bernie Sanders says, she's got bad judgment, they're right. She's got bad judgment, personally I think she's a very unstable person, if you wanna really know the truth. [applause] And we're gonna repeal and replace Obamacare, but you wanna know something? Honestly, I think for herself she's got much bigger problems right now than Obamacare. She's got bigger problems. [applause] Let's see what's on all those e-mails that they just found, see what's on those e-mails. Thank you. It's too bad those cameras aren't turning around to see this incredible group of people with thousands more outside, isn't it too bad? [applause] They don't do it. But you know, if Hillary speaks and there's 30 people in the line they say, the crowd is massive. [booing] She's never had a crowd like this in her life. [applause] President Obama shouldn't be campaigning for any longer, it's really a conflict, right? He oughta be working on jobs, on the border, on building up our military instead of campaigning for crooked Hillary Clinton, is what he oughta be doing. [applause] He's in North Carolina, but we're going to North Carolina right after this, so. [applause] But we have a few more today in Florida, and we have massive crowds. There's something happening. They're not reporting it. Katie, you're not reporting it, Katie. [applause] But there's something happening, Katie. There's something happening, Katie. A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And yes, we will build the wall. [applause] Thank you. [applause] We've received the first ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers. First time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate. [applause] They tell us the border crisis taking place right now is the worst it's ever been. Now, in all fairness, people probably figure that I'm going to win. [applause] So, they're racing across the border. I don't know. I'm sorry to do this to you, folks. [applause] Hillary has pledged totally open borders, meaning you don't have a country anymore. And she strongly supports sanctuary cities like in San Francisco where[booing] Right? Where Kate Steinle was killed by a five time deported illegal immigrant. [booing] The immigration officers warn that Hillary's plan is the most radical immigration proposal in U.S. history and that it will lead to the loss of thousands of lives. And I believe that. As secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free because their countries would not take them back. [booing] Countless innocent Americans have been killed by illegal immigrants. Last year, as an example, 17-year-old Starlett Pitts, her boyfriend and her mother were stabbed to death in their Lee High Acres home by an illegal immigrant. The killer had been convicted of assaulting a police officer and was wanted for double murder and robbery. And the people that knew him were begging that he be incarcerated. They were begging. He was released from custody pending his court appearance, enabling him to commit murder.  A Trump administration will stop illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens and save American lives. [applause] And I want to thank, by the way, I see all these signs—"Cubans for Trump." Cubans. I love Cubans. [applause] So they gave me last week the Bay of Pigs Association, right? You know. They gave me their award last week and it was a great honor. And we're gonna fight very hard for the Cubans and we're gonna fight very, very hard for the Hispanics because they have not been properly taken care of. What's happened with the Hispanic population in our country is not right. What's happened with the inner cities of our country, the African-American community, the Hispanic community, is very, very unfair. [applause] Thank you. Thank you. We're going to take care of it. The crime is horrible, the education is terrible, and you can't get a job. We're going to fix the inner cities—we're going to fix the inner cities.  Thank you, fellows, that's so good. Blacks for Trump. That's so nice. We will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. [applause] That includes total support for homestead air reserve base. A Trump administration will stand in solidarity with the suffering people of Cuba and Venezuela all surrounding Dural—all surrounding Dural against the oppression of the Castro and Maduro regimes, you know what I'm talking about.  We will cancel Obama's one-sided Cuban deal made by Executive Order. If we do not get the deal we want, and the deal that people living in Cuba and here deserve[applause] including protecting religious and political freedom, right? I'm honored to have the endorsement of over 200 top admirals and generals, and 22 Medal of Honor recipients. [applause] You know it's really called peace through strength. Peace through strength, that's what we're going to have, well, hopefully. Have to get rid of ISIS—we're going to get rid of ISIS, don't worry, we're getting rid of ISIS. But we have to get to rebuild our country.  We've spent six trillion dollars in the Middle East—six trillion dollars. And it's in far worse shape, by a factor of 10, from when we started. Six trillion—we lost lives, the most incredible, great people.  Our new foreign policy will put America first. Hillary brought disaster to Iraq and Syria and Libya. And she empowered Iran, remember, she's got bad judgment. And she unleashed ISIS, came right out of the vacuum. Now she wants to start a shooting war in Syria in conflict with nuclear-armed Russia. Frankly, it could lead to World War III and she has no sense. She's got no instinct, but that's decided  Hillary and our failed Washington establishment, they've spent that six trillion dollars. I mean, I'd love to have that money back, but I'd much rather have all those lives back—rather have all those lives. [applause] Love to have those lives back. But the Middle East is in bad shape folks, and it's getting worse, totally getting worse. They've dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe. They've left our borders wide open at home and they've shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries. And these are foreign wars that we don't win—we don't win. We don't win anymore, we don't win with trade, we don't win with wars, we don't win anymore. We're going to start winning again, you watch. We're going to start. [applause] To all Americans I say it's time for new leadership. Just think about what can be accomplished in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. We're going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. [applause] And she is going to raise your taxes very substantially, I think you know that. [booing] We will eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation, cancel every illegal Obama executive order, rebuild our military and take care of our great veterans. [applause] Provide school choice and put an end to Common Core; we're bringing our education local. [applause] Support the men and women of law enforcement. [applause] We're going to save our Second Amendment, which is under siege [applause] and appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. [applause] Clinton wants us to think small, wants us to believe things can't change and wants our lives to revolve around Washington. I wonder if she's going to be there much longer. What do you think? [booing] I don't think so. I don't know. I'm not sure she's going to be there. But she wants—she wants our lives to revolve around Washington, D.C. I'm asking you to dream big, to push for bold change and to believe in a movement powered by the people and by their love for this great country. [applause] I'm tired of politicians telling Americans to defer their dreams to another day when they really mean another decade. America is tired of waiting. The moment is now. All we have to do is stop believing in our failed politicians and start believing in each other and in our country. [applause] There is no challenge too great, no dream outside of our reach. Don't let anyone tell you it can't be done. The future lies with the dreamers, not the cynics, not the critics, certainly not the media. [booing] Hillary has been there for 30 years and she has accomplished nothing. She's just made things worse. Look at her record. She's the candidate of yesterday; we are the—right? Is that right?  We are the movement of the future. Our movement represents all Americans from all backgrounds and all walks of life. We are asking for the votes of Republicans and Democrats and independents and first time voters. And believe me, there are a lot of first time voters that are standing on line right now. [applause] We're asking for the vote of every American who believes truth and justice, not money and power, should rule the day. And I understand the other side very well. I've been there for a long time, but I love our country and I understand what has to be done. We are going in the wrong direction, and if we keep going in this direction, we won't have a country any longer. [booing] We're fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests. We're fighting to unlock the potential of every American community and every American family who hope and pray and yearn for a better future.  With your vote, we are just—think of it—six days away. [applause] This started on June 16th of last year. It's a long time. Seems like a long time ago. But we're six days away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life. It'll never happen again. It'll never, ever happen. It's not going to happen in four years. When I see Cubans for Trump, it'll never happen again. I'm telling you. This whole thing will never happen again.  There's never been a movement like this in the history of our country—there's never been a movement like this. Thank you. Thank you. There has never been a movement like this in the history of our country—it's never happened. Even the pundits, even the ones that truly dislike Donald Trump have said, it's the single greatest phenomena the have ever seen. We have to close the deal. We have to close—get out and vote. November 8th fine, better if you vote now.  Maybe you don't feel good November 8th, you don't want to get outta bed, you gotta get up, you gotta vote. Together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. [applause] Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. [applause] Get out and vote. God bless you, everybody. Thank you. [applause]
t72.txt:This is amazing. What a great place. Thank you very much. We have thousands of people outside trying to get in. But we should start. Do we agree? [applause] We should start. So they'll come in. They'll come in. First of all I want to thank you. Special, special place. It's a special place with incredible people. In one day, do you believe this? One day we are going to win the great state of North Carolina... [applause] And we are going to win back the White House. [applause] This election will decide whether we are ruled by a corrupt political class. You're seeing what's happening. Everybody's watching. Or whether we are ruled by the people. We're going to be ruled by the people, folks. [applause] That is going to be the choice. A failed political establishment has delivered nothing but poverty, nothing but problems, nothing but losses. Nothing but losses. We don't win anymore as a country. We're going to start winning again. [applause] They get rich by making America poorer in many cases. It's time to reject the media and political elite that has bled our country dry. [applause] And these are among the most dishonest people. They don't give you the truth, folks. They don't give you the truth. [booing] They rarely give you the truth. You know it. And they know it. That's the scary part. They know it. It's time to fight for America. I'm not a politician, I can say proudly. My only special interest is you. It's you. [applause] We're going to bring back the jobs that have been stolen from you. We're going to bring back the wealth that has been taken from our country. We're going to bring back the miners and the factory workers and the steel workers. We're going to put them back to work. [applause] The economic policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton have destroyed manufacturing in your state and throughout the entire country. The corrupt Clintons gave us NAFTA. China's too horrible entry into the World Trade Organization. One of the disasters. The job-killing deal with South Korea. That was a Hillary Clinton beauty. And the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will be a total disaster. [booing] That Hillary Clinton said this is the gold standard. And you know what? It is the gold -- she lied. She lied during the debate. She said -- hey, by the way, who won the debate? Did we win that debate? [applause] But she lied during the debate. She lied during the debate. She said it's the gold standard. And then she said she never said it. Don't worry about coal. We're bringing back coal, sir. He's holding up a couple of...[applause] Clean coal. Clean coal. Right? We're going to do clean coal, the miners. The miners are going to be back. Not if Hillary Clinton gets in. The miners, I guess you got to start thinking about something else. But the miners are going to be back. Clean coal. Clean coal You know, thinking about it, though. Also, people, the press doesn't talk about it. Donna Brazile gets the questions through a debate...[booing]...but then it turns out to be a number of debates. [booing] Who cares about Donna Brazile? She's turned out to be not what people thought. She gets, illegally -- illegally. She gets the questions to the debate. She then takes those questions and gives them to crooked Hillary Clinton. [booing] Now, does crooked Hillary report it? Does she say I shouldn't have these questions or these answers? I think they gave them the answers also, right? No, she doesn't. They doesn't.  I wonder if she had -- I wonder if she had the questions in my debates. I don't think so because she didn't do that well. I don't think so. I don't think so. But the years of betrayal will end. And they will end. And they're going to end quickly. They're going to end as of the day we take office, which is going to be very, very soon. [applause] The theft of North Carolina jobs will end. You've taken in harder than most states. Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. [applause] Sadly, it's just been announced that the residents of North Carolina are going to experience massive double-digit premium hikes. Ninety-five...[booing]...of the 100 North Carolina counties will only have one insurer in the Obamacare exchange next year. Lots of luck negotiating. Honestly, it's not going to matter because we're going to win and we're going to terminate it. You're going to have such great health care...[applause]...for much less money. It won't matter. [applause] Premiums are searching. Companies are leaving. Insurers are fleeing. Doctors are quitting. By the way, doctors, they're leaving. They're quitting. I have a friend who's a doctor. He said that I have more accountants than I have nurses, it's so complicated.  And deductibles are going through the roof. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down and expand Obamacare and make it even more expensive. [booing] I'm asking for your vote so we can repeal and replace Obamacare, and save health care for every family in North Carolina. [applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [applause] People are pouring in, folks. They're pouring in. Did you see last night in Michigan the crowd we had? And the crowd we had -- by the way, how about 24,000 maybe 25,000 right next to Fort Brag. You saw that the other night. [applause] And we went to Minnesota. Minnesota's been treated very, very badly. We went to Minnesota where we're doing very well. Everyone said why Minnesota? That doesn't go Republican. It's going Republican this year, I'll tell you. Minnesota. Great place.  And you know, you've been watching and you've been seeing and these people are being driven crazy, the dishonest media. We're winning Ohio. We're winning Iowa. We're winning, we think, New Hampshire. We're going to do great in New Hampshire. I hear we're winning North Carolina big... [applause] I hear. We're winning Florida. We're winning Florida, doing really well. Headlines today are on drudge. how well we're doing in Florida. And I think we're going to win the great state of Pennsylvania, I do.  Then we're winning plenty of other places. So we have to go. The big key, you have to go. You don't win a rigged system, folks. We're in a rigged system. You got to go. You got to vote. Got to make sure that vote gets registered.  Real change also means restoring honesty to our government Thank you. Thank you. Wow. Great, great spirit. I have a job right next to -- we have a beautiful, beautiful property right next to -- right near Charlotte. You know about it, folks? It's great right? Some of the people. But it's an amazing place. It's an amazing place to work and to live, and we love it.  Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency of the United States. [booing] She threatened national security, she sold her office to the highest bidder. And then to cover her tracks...[booing]...she deleted 33,000 emails after receiving a congressional subpoena, nothing happens to her. Nothing happens [booing] She's being protected by a totally rigged system -- General James Cartwright. A four-star general. Two weeks ago probably going to jail for up to five years for doing nothing by comparison. But he said he did it for national security reasons and I can understand that. Go to jail for up to five years. General betrayes, his life was destroyed and here she is she is running for president 25 times worse than anybody has ever dreamt. It's a rigged system. It is a rigged rigged system. [booing] Don't worry, folks. The cameras will never spin around and show this crowd. They never do. They show my face and the two people behind me, not the thousands behind me. They never do. They never do. [applause] [booing] So dishonest. There they are. There they are. My group. Women for Trump. [applause] Women for Trump. [applause] They've been following me, these ladies, for a long time. How are we doing? Are we doing well? Great people. Women for Trump. And now it's up to the American people to deliver the justice that we deserve at the ballot box tomorrow. At the ballot box. We're going to win. I think it's a great way of showing what we have to show in light of what's going on with justice in this country. I really do. I think it's a great way. You show it tomorrow. We show it tomorrow.  My contract with the American voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and to take our country back from the special interests. [applause] And folks, I was on the other side for a long time. It's a very good place to be. But I love the country. I love this country. I've really gotten to love the people of this country because I have been everywhere. We have the greatest people on earth. But I love this country.  And I couldn't watch it when they made the Iran deal. They gave them $150 billion, a terrorist state. [booing] A state that was ready to collapse until we made them rich and powerful. We gave them a path to nuclear weapons. They were ready to collapse. We gave them, remember, $400 billion, right? We gave them $400 million. Then we found out that was -- it wasn't $400 million. It was $1.7 billion in cash. In cash. Do you know what $1.7 billion in cash is? You could take that whole side of the arena and you wouldn't have enough room. How stupid are we to allow this to happen? Our leaders are incompetent. President Obama is campaigning today with Hillary Clinton because she can't campaign. [booing] She can't campaign. [booing] So Obama is taking Air Force One, which costs a fortune. You know he's very much into the environment. And he'll take a massive, old engine 747. Very much into the environment. Very much into the ozone layer. And yet he'll fly that 747 all over the place to campaign for crooked Hillary.  And I don't think it's going to work. And she's not getting any crowds. So she gets Beyonce and Jay-Z. I like them. [booing] I like them. [booing] And you know what they do? I get bigger crowds than they do. [applause] It's true. I get far bigger crowds. [applause] Look at this place. I mean, look at the crowds we had in Michigan. By the way, Michigan is in play. It hasn't been in play for Republicans for 30 something years. Michigan is in play because they're tired of watching their car factories be taken out. They're tired of losing their jobs to Mexico.  Ford. Ford right now moved all of its small car production to Mexico. They're building the biggest plants in the world in Mexico. And Michigan has been complaining about it for five years to Mexico. [applause] No, we're going to have some -- tomorrow's going to be a very historic day. I really believe that. I think it's going to show -- I think it's going to be a Brexit plus, plus, plus. Does that make sense? [applause] Plus, plus, plus. [applause] It will be amazing. It will be amazing. I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear the words we're all about to say. This is a phrase, I told you. I didn't like it. I thought it was hokie. But it's not hokie. It's called "drain the swamp." We're going to go to Washington. We're going to drain the swamp. Can't believe it. I told the story. I hated that expression. I said no way I'm going to say that, no way. That's so hokie. And I said it. The place went crazy. Then I said it to another place. It went crazier. Then I said it with more confidence because you know confidence is -- and it went wild. Now I love the expression. I think it was genius.  Drain the swamp. Drain the swamp. [laughter] Is there any place better to be than a Trump rally? Are we having fun? [applause] Are we having fun? No? And I don't have a guitar. And I don't have a piano. All we have is great concepts for our country, which is the most important thing. Because frankly, when people get on stage, and they're entertainers, and they entertain in order to get people to fill up a room for Hillary Clinton.  And by the way, they use the dirtiest language the other night. And it was -- many of the people left. You know they're political people. They heard words they've never heard before. They left.  So the place was half empty by the time -- actually, it never got full, even with them. Then it was pretty much empty midway through. And then most of the people just left. And when Hillary got up there was practically -- she might as well just have started with a few people. It would've been easier. [laughter] But you know she hears those words. I won't use the words. I won't even address the words. Because if I do the crooked media will say "did you hear what Donald Trump said today?" [booing] But honestly -- yes. [booing] Those words were disgusting. If I ever said those words that Jay-Z said or that Beyonce said the other night, you know what would happen to me? The reinstitution of the electric chair.  It would be -- how about if I got the answers to the debate? Or if I got the questions? Supposing instead of Hillary getting the questions to the debate, which is cheating. She's a cheat. She is a cheat. She never reported it. She is a cheat.  So supposing instead of her -- supposing somebody gave Donald Trump the questions to the debate. Headlines all over the world. He must withdraw from the race. You don't even hear anything about crooked Hillary. She got the questions.  To me that's such a big difference. Some people say, my people, oh don't mention that, it's just -- I say to me it's a big deal. It's a big deal. But it's not a big deal for the dishonest media to say. They don't want to report it. But just think about it, supposing it was us. At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. Bring them back to America. [applause] And by the way, you have a great governor. Support your governor. He's a great guy. [applause] Where is he? He's here someplace. He's a great guy and he's in a tough fight. And he's going to win that fight. But he's a great guy. So hopefully you'll support your governor.  North Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and his lovely wife, Hillary. [booing] Well think of it. Think of it. Think of the numbers of jobs. Here's the one that gets me the most. Two things get me the most. Two things that just don't seem real. Because we're going to take care of our veterans, right? Like big league. Because our veterans are great.  But two statistics I can't believe. Twenty-two suicides a day for our veterans. Think of it. You wouldn't think that's possible. Because they're treated so badly. They wait on line for six, seven, eight days for simple procedure that could solve their problem or for a prescription.  But two numbers I don't -- it just doesn't make sense. Twenty- two suicides a day for our veterans. OK? It doesn't make sense. And here's another one. America has lost 70,000 factories. Now I thought they meant 700 or 7,000 maybe. It's 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary Clinton-backed disaster.  Think of it though. [booing] Think of what 70,000 factories is. So those are the two numbers. They just don't seem to be real. Sad numbers. Sad numbers. Especially the vets, to be honest with you. We're living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of our world. There's never been anything happened to a country like has been happening to the United States. Our jobs are fleeing. Our companies are being taken. And leaving. And leaving.  A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America. And we will stop the jobs from leaving North Carolina. Believe me. [applause] If a company wants to fire their workers and leave, as an example North Carolina, and move to another country, and then ship their products back into the United States through what will be a very strong border, by the way.  We will make them pay a 35 percent tax on every product that they ship back here. [applause] And here's what's going to happen. They're not going to leave. They're not going to leave. Now your politicians, some of them don't understand it. Some only cut taxes for the middle class. And by the way, Hillary Clinton wants to raise your taxes, and you know that [booing] Substantially. So one of the highest taxes in the world, she wants to raise your taxes. Same old story. We will unleash the power of American energy including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal. Our plan will end the EPA intrusion into your family farms, and stop double taxation of a family farm at that. [applause] We will cancel billions in global warming payments to the United Nations. Billions and billions of dollars. And we have no idea what they do with that money. I actually have a pretty good idea. You're not going to like it. And use that -- we're going to use that money to rebuild the infrastructure of our country. [applause] And we will rebuild our inner cities. The African-American community, the Hispanic community...[applause]...have had such lies told to them. They live -- many, many people living in the inner cities of our country, they're getting worse and worse. The crime is unbelievable. You can't walk to the store and get a loaf of bread. Often you get shot.  Chicago. Thousands and thousands of shootings since Jan. 1. You read it. The murder rate of the United States is the highest it's been in 45 years. The dishonest media doesn't tell you that stuff because they want you to like Obama. They want you to think Obama is doing a good job. And he's not. [booing] And he's not. [booing] And he's not. [booing] So you live in the inner cities. You're African-American. You're Hispanic. The schools are no good. There are no jobs. And it's totally unsafe. And I say I will fix it. What the hell do you have to lose? I'm going to fix it. [applause] We are all going to fix it. [applause] We're going to fix it. We're going to bring back jobs. We're going to bring back safety. And we're going to get really good education going. There is tremendous potential, folks, in the inner cities, believe me, tremendous potential.  We will become a rich nation again. But to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees flowing into our country. [booing] Unbelievable. It's unbelievable. [booing] Her plan will import generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism into your schools and throughout your communities. And you don't even know where they're going. Your government doesn't even know where they're going.  When I'm elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program...[applause]...and we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. [applause] Have no choice. [applause] We have no choice. AUDIENCE: USA. USA. USA.  TRUMP: We have no choice. But we're going to work because we all have hearts and it's a big problem, caused to a large extent by Obama and Hillary Clinton. The migration, caused to a large extent -- ISIS was caused by them. They left a big vacuum. There was no ISIS when she first served as secretary. There was no ISIS. She created it.  Now she stands at the debate, "I will fight ISIS." She's got no chance. She's going to fight nobody. She wants to go home and go to sleep. [laughter] Unbelievable. She's going to fight ISIS. So we're going to build -- we're going to build, we are going to build safe havens. We're going to have the Gulf States who have nothing but money, they're going to pay for it. We have $20 trillion in debt. And if it's OK, I'm not going to spend a penny. We have $20 trillion in debt. And we still have to rebuild our country.  You know it's one thing like when you buy a company and it's got some debt. We have $20 trillion in debt. But the country's a mess. The roads are bad. The bridges are bad. The schools are bad. The hospitals are bad. The tunnels are bad. Everything's bad. The military needs massive amounts of money.  So we have all this horrible debt. It's one thing if we had it and everything's in tippy top shape. I like to say. You know I like the properties. Give me them. I want them. Give me them. But we have them and they're a mess. And we have $20 trillion, which is far too much.  So we're going to get it down. And we're going to rebuild our country. We have so many things we're going to be doing. We're going to be a rich nation again. [applause] A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. [applause] And yes, we will build a great wall and Mexico will pay for the wall 100 percent. [applause] One hundred percent. [applause] Mexico will pay. If you look at the incredible -- if you look at the incredible deficits we have with Mexico, it's unbelievable. What we have, the cost of that wall is peanuts, is peanuts compared to the numbers you're talking about on trade with Mexico.  And the numbers with China? Trade deficit? I mean we will have a trade deficit with China of close to $500 billion this year. We are going to lose in worldwide trade of goods, we're going to lose worldwide close to $800 billion. What are we doing?  You really ask, who is negotiating these deals? Where do these people come? You know where they come from? They're political hacks. You're dealing with the smartest people in the world. You have Chinese people, every -- you have from Japan, you have from all these other countries. They put their smartest and the best. We put political hacks that don't know what they're doing.  So we have an -- and we have the greatest in the world. We have the greatest business people. We have the greatest negotiators. We don't use them. We don't use them. We use political people. Some of them got their job because they give campaign contributions. [booing] We're going to get it straightened out, folks, starting tomorrow. Go vote. Go vote. [applause] Right? My women. Hillary supports totally open borders. There goes your country. And strongly supports sanctuary cities like San Francisco where Kate Steinle was murdered violently by an illegal immigrant deported at least five times. We will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities. [applause] We will stop illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens and dismantle every last criminal gang and cartel threatening our citizens. [applause] We will also repeal the Obama-Clinton Defense sequester, and rebuild our badly depleted military. [applause] There have been few times in our history where we've needed it more, few times. North Carolina will be at the very center of this effort with brand new advanced fighters flying from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base. [applause] Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful, beautiful new fighters from Seymour Johnson. And we're going to have more battalions. You know the Marines are way, way off in terms of numbers. You know that. I know. Has there ever been? Yes, there have been. But rarely do we have times when we need this strong presence like now. The world hates us. The world hates us.  So we're going to increase -- thank you. We're going to increase Marine battalions at Camp Lejeune. I've been to Camp Lejeune...[applause] They make major new investments. Where I was the other night, right next to it. I guess like 25,000 or 27,000 people at Fort Bragg. [applause] Great people. All soldiers are tough. A couple of them shook my hand. It was like oy, whoa. Take it easy, fellas. They are tough cookies. They are strong. They don't know how strong they are. These are great people.  And new military technologies will be researched and developed right here at the Research Triangle. Right here. [applause] I'm honored to have the endorsements of more than 200 top admirals and generals, and 22 Medal of Honor recipients. And every day those numbers go up big league. Big league. Show Less Text And I asked some of the generals and admirals the other night by Fort Bragg. I asked them. I said fellas, let me ask you a question. They want to take over Mosul. Am I getting something wrong? Whatever happened to the element of surprise for us?  I'm talking to admirals now and generals. That's what they do. I do other things. But you know it's called like common sense. You got to say we've made a lot of right calls. I said why is it that four months away from going into Mosul they're announcing "we are going into Mosul?" We're going into Mosul because we want to get the leaders of ISIS and they're staying in Mosul. And then three months they're saying "we are going in, in three months to Mosul." And then we're going in, in two months.  And every time I hear, I put my hands, I go like this. I don't want to hear this, please. And as you know, they've been met with tremendous resistance, much more than they would've been And I guarantee you this. I can't say it with certainty, only about 99.9 percent, OK? I can't say -- nothing's 100 percent. Even our victory isn't 100 percent. But it's starting to look pretty close, isn't it? [applause] Those numbers. Those numbers. [applause] Oh, these guys are unhappy. Look at them. They're not happy. They are unhappy campers. Starting to look good. [booing] Starting to look good. But wouldn't it be nice if instead of announcing four months ago and there months ago. Then they have last -- two weeks ago they go next week we're getting ready to raid.  The leaders all left. They're gone. And the other people are putting up much more of a fight. Horrible. They're using human shields. It's a horrible situation. I mean it's hell. It's hell. But why do we just watch what's going on. Hillary and her failed establishment have trillion dollars on wars in the Middle East that we never win. We just keep fighting and fighting. It's like a hose. The money just keeps pouring out. We never win.  And now the Middle East is in worse shape by far than it's ever been. We have the Great Migration, the whole thing. They've dragged -- thank you. [applause] I don't even want to look. I'll get myself. I don't want to look. [laughter] They'll make it -- I won't even say I love you too because they're going to make it a major headline if I said that. World's most dishonest people. The world's really dishonest people. [booing] They dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe. Shipped our jobs and wealth all over -- right open at home. You ever notice we send these incredible troops, so much death, so much injury, in order to create a border for a country that most people have never even heard of. And yet we don't protect our own borders. Isn't it an incredible thing?  That will change starting tomorrow. [applause] Because from now on it's going to be America first, America first. [applause] So just in summing up, to all Americans I say it's time for a real leadership and time for change. We have to have change. [applause] Can you imagine having Hillary for four years? [booing] I'm being serious about that. I wouldn't want to watch the news every night. I mean look at what she's done with the e-mails as an example. I mean did you ever see a mess like this? Did you ever see -- of course the FBI -- the director was obviously under tremendous pressure. So they went through 650,000 e-mails in eight days. Right.  So sad what's going on. And she still deleted them after getting a subpoena from Congress. I mean that's a crime. What happened? That's a crime. You don't even need the new stuff. She shouldn't be allowed to run. Shouldn't be allowed to run. Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. [applause] We're going to have the biggest tax cuts since Ronald Reagan. And Hillary is going to raise your taxes substantially. We're going to save and protect your Social Security and Medicare. [applause] And Hillary is going to cut your Social Security and really injure Medicare. That's what's going to happen. We will eliminate every unnecessary, job-killing regulation. We'll cancel every illegal Obama executive order. [applause] By the way, a man that loves this state. It's his birthday today. Billy Graham, 98. [applause] The father of Franklin. Billy Graham. What a great one, right? Ninety-eight years old. He is a fantastic man. Franklin's a fantastic man. And it's so wonderful to have support of people like that.  We're going to protect religious liberty...[applause]...rebuild our military and take care of our great veterans. We're going to take care of our veterans. [applause] We will provide school choice and put an end to Common Core. We move our education locally. [applause] We will support the men and women -- these are great people, the men and women of law enforcement. [applause] We're going to save our Second Amendment. [applause] And appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. [applause] This sounds so good to me because I started this on June 16th of last year because I couldn't stand when I looked at what was going on with our country, I couldn't stand it. I couldn't stand it.  Coming down the escalator, right, with Melania. Coming down that escalator June 16 of last year. And they were all saying -- there were all the dishonest pundits. Actually a few of them thought I had a hell of a chance if you want to know the -- the smarter ones. But they were all saying but he's not involved with -- I've been involved with politics all my life, on the other side. But I've been involved.  We had 17 people -- by the way, one of the great people in here tonight, Mike Huckabee. Where is Mike Huckabee? [applause] He's such -- is he here someplace? He is here. He is so great. Mike, wherever you are, come on out because you are great. I just saw him. But we had 17 people of great talent. Ben Carson endorsed us. Mike...[applause] Mike endorsed us. Tremendous -- I mean very talented people. And one by one by one -- and they used to say -- well I remember we were down to like 13 or 14. In one state I got 49 percent. And one of these clowns said "he has not reached the 50 percent mark." I got 49 percent with like 14 people. How do you get 49 percent with 14 people? And they said he hasn't reached the 50 percent mark. They're very dishonest people.  So we ended up with 17 people, right? Don't forget that's hard because nobody else ever had a field that big or that violent, or that violent. And we have a couple that didn't endorse and that's too bad. You know they signed a pledge. They didn't honor it. But...[booing] But -- no. But for the most part...[booing] No. For the most part they were very honorable. But it was rough. They said it was the roughest primary every. I would say this is the roughest election. You know the NFL ratings are way down. You know why? Because everyone's watching this. It's actually tougher. It's actually tougher. [applause] Everyone's watching. The NFL ratings are way down. A lot of people say it's because of this. So you had 17 people. You've came down -- but we've got -- and this is a tribute to everybody in this room. We got the highest number of voters in the history of the Republican primary system. [applause] So well done. [applause] That's a long time. You know, starting with Honest Abe Lincoln, right. That's a long time. I got more than Honest Abe. That's really the only thing I did better than Honest Abe. Honest Abe was pretty -- he was pretty good.  So here's the beauty. You have one day until the election. And it's not even one day. It's a half a day. To make every dream you've ever dreamed for your country and for your family to come true. You have one magnificent chance. And honestly, in four years it's over, folks.  There has never been a movement like this. Even these dishonest people in the media say there has never -- Bill O'Reilly. He said it's the single greatest political phenomena that he's witnessed in his life. That's a pretty good statement. [applause] But others have said it. Others have said it. Others have said it. And it's not going to happen again. It won't be able to happen again. Four years it'll never happen. So you got to get out there and you got to vote. Got to get out.  Somebody said what you've done has never been done before. It doesn't matter if you win or lose. I said believe me, it matters. No, they said that. It'll be down in the history books. I said you know what? You may be right about that.  But if we don't win I will consider this the single greatest waste of time, energy. Wow do I -- you need energy for this. The single greatest waste of time, energy and money.  I have over $100 million. That's a lot of money that I don't take in from the special interests because I don't need it. That's nice. And we have the biggest Internet -- you know the small donors? The small donors are giving us money at record clips. I think we had $82 million and then we had close to $100 million. And it comes in. And I think the average was like $61 each. I love those people. Those are people that love this country. [applause] And usually that's for the Democrats. You know in all fairness, that's usually for the Democrats to do that. But we're beating everybody. Nobody's seen anything like what we're doing.  So we don't want to blow it. We don't want to waste it. Go vote. Go vote. Because believe me, if we don't win, all of us, honestly we've all wasted our time, I'll be honest. Because nothing's going to happen.  They may say good things about us as a movement. Won't mean a damn thing, folks. You got to go out. We got to vote and we got to win. Change. [applause] Change. So you have one magnificent chance to beat the corrupt system that you're witnessing today, and to deliver justice for every forgotten man and woman and child in this nation. Do not let this opportunity slip away. We're fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests. [applause] And we're fighting, we're fighting to bring us all together as Americans. We're a very divided country. People don't realize we are an unbelievably divided country. We're going to come together.  Just imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God, saluting one American flag. [applause] Just imagine. I'm asking you to dream big because with your vote we are just one day away from the change you've been waiting for, for your entire life. [applause] Because if we win tomorrow, we will be able to make America wealthy again, to make America strong again, to make America safe again, and to make America great again.  God bless you, everybody. [applause] Thank you. God bless you. Thank you, North Carolina. [applause] Thank you, folks. Thank you. [applause]
